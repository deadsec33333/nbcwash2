<p>A popular brand of liquid laundry detergent is recalling thousands of bottles due to &#8220;risk of exposure to bacteria,&#8221; according to an announcement from the <a href="https://www.woolite.us/Voluntary-Recall/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.woolite.us/Voluntary-Recall/">U.S Consumer Product Safety Commission</a>.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/tag/recalls/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcchicago.com/tag/recalls/">recall,</a> issued Mar. 20, applies to 50 fluid-ounce bottles of liquid Woolite Delicates detergent, the announcement said. Approximately 16,200 bottles were recalled, with lot codes S24364, S24365 and S24366. Each of the bottles is white with a light pink label and cap, the announcement said.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" width="451" height="465" src="https://media.nbcwashington.com//2025/03/Woolite.png?w=451&#038;resize=451%2C465&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="" class="wp-image-10348211" srcset="https://media.nbcwashington.com/2025/03/Woolite.png?w=451&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 451w, https://media.nbcwashington.com/2025/03/Woolite.png?w=291&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 291w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px" /></figure>



<p>According to the announcement, the recalled products contain &#8220;Pseudomonas species bacteria,&#8221; including Pseudomonas oleovorans, an environmental organism found in soil and water. Those with weakened immune systems or external medical devices who are exposed to the bacteria could face the risk of &#8220;serious infection&#8221; and could require medical treatment.</p>



<p>According to the announcement such bacteria can enter the body through the eyes or a break in the skin. Those with healthy immune systems are not typically affected by the bacteria, the announcement said.</p>



<p>Customers are advised to immediately stop using the products, which were sold exclusively on Amazon.com, and contact the manufacturer for a full refund.

				<![CDATA[
<p>Segway is recalling about 220,000 of its scooters sold across the U.S. due to a fall hazard that has resulted in user injuries ranging from bruises to broken bones.</p>



<p>According to a notice published by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the folding mechanism in Segway&#8217;s Ninebot Max G30P and Max G30LP KickScooters can fail during use — causing the handlebars or stem of the scooters to fold.</p>



<p>That can result in serious injuries, the Commission warns. Thursday&#8217;s recall notice notes that Segway has received 68 reports of folding mechanism failures — and 20 injuries that include abrasions, bruises, lacerations and broken bones.</p>

<p>Consumers in possession of these now-recalled scooters are urged to stop using them immediately and contact Segway to request a free maintenance kit. This kit includes tools and step-by-step instructions to inspect and adjust the scooters&#8217; locking mechanism as needed, Segway says.</p>



<p>“Over time, depending on riding conditions, the folding mechanism may require periodic checks and tightening,” California-based Segway writes on its website. “No returns or replacements are involved.”</p>



<p>According to the CPSC, the Segway scooters involved in this recall were manufactured in China and Malaysia and sold at in-person retailers across the U.S. — like Best Buy, Costco, Walmart, Target and Sam’s Club, as well as online at Segway.com and Amazon.com, between January 2020 and February 2025. Sale prices ranged from $600 to $1,000.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service issued a recall of approximately 29,541 pounds of ready-to-eat beef stick brand Chomps on Wednesday after discovering metal in the product.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Certain cans of green beans sold at Target stores are being recalled over concerns they could be contaminated with a foreign object.</p>



<p>Del Monte Foods, Inc., issued a voluntary recall last month for nearly 200,000 cans of the Target brand Good &amp; Gather Cut Green Beans, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/ires/?Product=212582" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Food and Drug Administration</a>.</p>



<p>The FDA did not specify what the foreign object might be.</p>



<div class="wp-block-nbc-html-block html-block"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" style="margin-bottom: 0px" src="https://media.nbcwashington.com//image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/cut-green-beans-good-and-gather-recall-mc-250320-de794f.jpg?w=900&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="Green beans" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Target&#8217;s Good &amp; Gather Cut Green Beans. (Target)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The agency noted in a report that this is a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/industry-guidance-recalls/recalls-background-and-definitions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Class II recall</a>, which means exposure to a product “may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences,” or may indicate a situation in which “probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.”</p>



<p>Canned green beans with the following description are involved in the recall, according to the FDA:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Product name: </strong>Good &amp; Gather Cut Green Beans, Net Wt. 14.5 oz</li>



<li><strong>UPC:</strong> 0 85239-11628 9</li>



<li><strong>Product details:</strong> Best if Used by 28 OCT 2026, Lot 7AA 418507</li>
</ul>



<p>The recall affects cans sold in 21 states: Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This week, certain varieties of Lean Cuisine and Stouffer’s meals were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/food/recall/lean-cuisine-stouffers-recall-rcna197028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also voluntarily recalled</a>&nbsp;over possible foreign object contamination, with the FDA citing the possible presence of “wood-like material” in the packaged meals.</p>



<p>Food recalls involving foreign object contamination are relatively rare; of all the food recalls issued by the FDA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture last year, just over 4% were due to foreign objects, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://pirg.org/resources/food-for-thought-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PIRG</a>, a consumer advocacy group.</p>



<p>Last year, the most common cause of food recalls in the U.S. was undeclared allergens (34.1%), followed by listeria contamination (22%).</p>



<p>Multiple food recalls have been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/recall/food-recalls-this-week-march-17-rcna196751" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced this month</a>. On March 13, Trader Joe’s recalled certain lots of Gerolsteiner sparkling water over concerns that in rare cases, the glass bottles holding the water could crack along the bottom.</p>



<p>Certain macaroni and cheese bites sold at Whole Foods were also recalled because they may contain undeclared egg and meat ingredients, according to the FDA.</p>



<p>SeaBear Company also recently recalled two varieties of its seafood chowder due to potential contamination with a bacterium that can cause botulism, a possibly fatal form of food poisoning.</p>

<p>The medicine poses a risk of poisoning if the contents are swallowed by young children, according to the <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2025/Arsell-Recalls-Benadryl-Liquid-Elixir-100-mL-Bottle-Due-to-of-Child-Poisoning-Violation-of-Federal-Regulation-for-Child-Resistant-Packaging-Sold-on-Amazon-com" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2025/Arsell-Recalls-Benadryl-Liquid-Elixir-100-mL-Bottle-Due-to-of-Child-Poisoning-Violation-of-Federal-Regulation-for-Child-Resistant-Packaging-Sold-on-Amazon-com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Consumer Products Safety Commission</a>.</p>



<p>Arsell issued a recall involving about 2,300 bottles of Benadryl Liquid Elixir sold from July 2023 through October 2024.</p>



<p>The 100 mL bottle contains diphenhydramine, which must be in child-resistant packaging as required by the Poison Prevention Packaging Act. </p>

				<![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tesla</a>&nbsp;is recalling more than 46,000 of its Cybertrucks due to a cosmetic exterior trim panel that it said can “delaminate and detach from the vehicle,” potentially becoming a road hazard and “increasing the risk of a crash.”</p>



<p>The voluntary recall covers a part of the vehicle known as a cant rail and affects all Cybertrucks manufactured from November 2023 to February 2025, Tesla wrote in its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/?nhtsaId=25V170000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filing</a>&nbsp;to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration dated March 18.</p>



<p>Owners of affected vehicles can take their Cybertrucks to Tesla’s service department for free replacement of the cant rail, the company wrote.</p>



<p>Tesla’s value has dropped by around 40% year to date as <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/tag/elon-musk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CEO Elon Musk</a> works as a top advisor to <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/tag/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">President Donald Trump</a> and leads the administration’s job-slashing team known as the <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/national-international/what-is-the-department-of-government-efficiency-doge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Government Efficiency</a>.</p>



<p>Waves of protests against Tesla and Musk have followed some of his political rhetoric and work in <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/tag/trump-administration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Trump administration</a>.</p>

<p>Because of its unique design, the angular unpainted steel Cybertruck is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cybertruck-owners-tesla-takedown-protest-harassment-vandalism-2025-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">frequently targeted</a>&nbsp;by people who oppose Musk. Cybertruck owners have complained online of everything from rude gestures to harassment and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3pY2HVRorg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vandalism</a>.</p>



<p>Tesla&nbsp;also faces increasing competition in battery electric vehicles, and like other U.S. automakers it is dealing with tariff and trade uncertainty after Trump signed multiple executive orders imposing major new tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and mainland China.</p>



<p>Tesla does not break out sales figures by model. However, the recalled vehicles represent a majority of Cybertrucks on the road.</p>



<p>Since Tesla began deliveries of its unusual pickup truck in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/30/tesla-set-to-reveal-cybertruck-details-at-austin-deliveries-event.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 2023</a>, the Cybertruck has been plagued by manufacturing problems and quality issues. The NHTSA’s website reflects that there have been nine recalls of the Cybertruck.</p>



<p>Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>On Thursday, The Information&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/exclusive-electric-tesla-plans-soon-introduce-long-awaited-battery-innovation-cybertrucks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>&nbsp;that Tesla plans to introduce Cybertruck battery tech in 2025 that would “sharply decrease battery manufacturing costs,” citing a senior executive.</p>



<p>“The adhesive used to hold the piece can fail, causing the cant rail to separate from the vehicle,” read a portion of a statement from NHTSA. “Tesla is not aware of any crashes, injuries or fatalities related to the issue.”</p>



<p>The NHTSA said Tesla implemented the recall after “discussions” with the automotive safety agency. They also noted that vehicle owners with a safety complaint or concern can fill out a&nbsp;<a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.nhtsa.gov/report-a-safety-problem*index__;Iw!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!q__Q1Mhfjwm5UmQJeepoZJaBbwZU3DfwSOQqPWggNlrdQmKT_oYhPninwYyhHM2ff7LTcmMOcF13HYCHm3RBfk-cNQ$" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vehicle Owner’s Questionnaire</a>&nbsp;online, or call the agency’s hotline to let regulators know there may be an issue. The number is:&nbsp;888-327-4236.</p>

<p>According to the FDA, bottles of the product may contain sriracha sauce, which contains sulfites not listed on the habanero buffalo sauce label. People who are allergic to these sulfites run the risk of serious and potentially life-threatening allergic reactions if consumed. </p>



<p>The impacted products were distributed between Feb. 5 and March 26. The best-by date is located on the top of the side of the 2 fl. oz bottles, on the back label for the 20 oz bottles, on top of the cap for the 12 fl. oz and half gallon jugs.</p>



<p>The company is also recalling select lots and sizes of Texas Pete Sweet CHAbanero Sauce because the bottles fail to contain the labeled ingredient &#8220;aged peppers.&#8221; </p>



<p>No illnesses have been reported to date, according to the FDA. </p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Triangle Tube gas boilers across the country have been recalled due to carbon monoxide concerns.</p>



<p>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and Triangle Tube <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2025/Triangle-Tube-Recalls-Prestige-and-Aerco-Esteem-Gas-Boilers-Due-to-Carbon-Monoxide-CO-Poisoning-Hazard-Two-Deaths-Reported" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced Thursday</a> that the Prestige Solo, Prestige Excellence and Aerco Esteem condensing gas boilers have been recalled.</p>



<p>The boilers were found to be releasing carbon monoxide due to delayed ignitions or component damage. Two people died as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning, including a 47-year-old woman in 2015 and an 85-year-old man in 2016.</p>



<p>More than 60,000 products sold in the U.S. since 2011 are impacted by the recall, plus another 7,500 sold in Canada. There have been 25 reports of carbon monoxide leaks from the recalled boilers.</p>



<p>Consumers with recalled boilers should contact Triangle Tube via phone, email or <a href="https://triangletube.com/products/product-recall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online</a> to set up an inspection, with free replacements available if necessary.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>A range of milkshakes have been recalled after they were linked to 11 deaths and dozens of serious illnesses, many of them in long-term care homes and hospitals, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/outbreak-investigation-listeria-monocytogenes-frozen-supplemental-shakes-february-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FDA confirmed</a>&nbsp;on Friday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Food service company Lyons Magnus&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lyons-magnus-recalls-lyons-readycare-and-sysco-imperial-frozen-supplemental-shakes-manufactured-by-third-party-because-of-possible-health-risk-302382823.html" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> Saturday it was voluntarily recalling all 4 oz. packs of Lyons ReadyCare and Sysco Imperial Frozen Supplemental Shakes, in response to a recall from manufacturer Prairie Farms, based in Fort Wayne, Indiana.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As of Friday, 38 people have been infected across 21 states. Of these, 27 were hospitalized and 11 died — although the FDA did not say when these deaths took place and said the outbreak can be traced back seven years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some 34 victims were either residents in long-term care facilities or had already been hospitalized. Records from the facilities involved showed that the shakes were available to residents and patients, the FDA said.</p>



<p>The FDA said it was first notified of an outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes linked to the product on Nov. 25 last year &#8220;with many ill people residing in long-term care facilities (LTCF) prior to illness onset.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;As soon as Lyons Magnus learned of the issue, it took immediate action to halt the purchase of all products from the affected Prairie Farms facility, notify customers, and ensure that impacted products were removed from distribution nationally,&#8221; the company said in its statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FDA said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that this outbreak can be traced back to 2018, although it was not clear exactly how, when or where the infections were reported.</p>



<p>Symptoms of Listeriosis, a listeria infection, typically start two weeks after eating contaminated food but can start up to 10 weeks later. These may include fever, muscle aches and nausea and in serious cases confusion, stiff neck and convulsions. Pregnant women, people over the age of 65 and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk.</p>



<p>An infant died and 10 adults were sickened amid a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/infant-dies-10-sickened-listeria-outbreak-tied-ready-eat-meat-rcna181459" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four-state listeria outbreak</a>&nbsp;connected to ready-to-eat meat products last year.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/tag/food-and-drug-administration/" target="_blank">Food and Drug Administration</a> has updated a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/riverside-natural-foods-inc-issues-voluntary-recall-select-madegood-granola-bar-products-over" target="_blank">December granola bar recall</a> that affected 2.4 million MadeGood granola bars.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/tag/recalls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recall</a> is now classified as Class II, meaning the consumption of affected products could cause &#8220;temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote,&#8221; according to the<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/postmarket-requirements-devices/recalls-corrections-and-removals-devices" target="_blank">&nbsp;FDA.</a></p>



<p>Riverside Natural Foods, Inc. preemptively issued <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.madegoodfoods.com/pages/recall?srsltid=AfmBOoqVkMbMalVMYHRamZmsh1YYjq4edEbQEDm7FCtkB0Xjex59ztu6" target="_blank">a voluntary recall</a> of 2,408,883 cases of MadeGood granola bars on Dec. 9, 2024. That came after certain batches produced between January and November 2024 were found to potentially contain metal.</p>



<p>The company described the piece of metal as a &#8220;small, flat brush bristle.&#8221;</p>



<p>At the time of the recall, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://madegoodfoods.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/31692468452251-MadeGood-Granola-Bar-Voluntary-Recall" target="_blank">MadeGood said</a> no injuries had been reported.</p>



<p>The affected products included 12 flavors sold in the U.S., Canada and other international markets, the company said. According to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.madegoodfoods.com/pages/find-in-store" target="_blank">its website</a>, MadeGood granola bars can be found at Target, Walmart, Whole Foods, Amazon and other major in person and online retailers.</p>



<p>Customers are advised to check the product codes and sell-by dates on their purchased boxes. Those who suspect they purchased an affected product may also return the bars to the store from which they were purchased for a full refund.</p>



<p>Consumers with further questions urged to contact MadeGood customer service at (855)215-5695 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. EST or visit the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://madegoodfoods.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank">MadeGood website</a>.</p>



<p>A complete list of affected flavors, products and sell-by dates can be found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0256/0583/2770/files/Final_US_Product_List_for_Website_2.pdf?v=1737388083" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>



<p>In January, Quaker Oats <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/national-international/quaker-oats-expands-recall-of-granola-bars-and-cereal-over-salmonella-risks/3245394/" target="_blank">issued a similar recall</a> over possible salmonella contamination in several granola bar and cereal products.</p>

<p>Consumers are instructed to immediately uninstall and stop using the recalled ropes. There have been 13 reports of the ropes breaking, according to the CPSC, and that includes one reported fall that resulted in a severe spinal cord injury.</p>



<p>The CPSC said about 22,500 units of the recalled ropes were sold in the U.S., with around 350 sold in Canada and roughly 25 in Mexico. The ropes were sold in lengths ranging from 10 to 50 feet on Amazon.com from March 2021 through November 2024.</p>



<p>Consumers can start the process for a full refund at <a href="http://www.logestroperecall.com/">LoGestRopeRecall.com</a>. The CPSC said consumers will receive a form to sign with disposal instructions and must email a photo of the disposed rope to <a href="mailto:LoGestRecall@gmail.com">LoGestRecall@gmail.com</a> in order to be eligible for the refund.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Igloo coolers have been recalled over a major safety concern.</p>



<p>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2025/Igloo-Recalls-More-Than-One-Million-90-Quart-Rolling-Coolers-Due-to-Fingertip-Amputation-and-Crushing-Hazards" target="_blank">shared Thursday</a> that Igloo 90-quart flip and tow rolling coolers have been recalled due to a risk of fingertip amputation and crushing hazards.</p>



<p>The tow handle can pinch consumers&#8217; fingertips against the cooler, which leads to the risk. The firm has received 12 reports of injuries, including fingertip amputations, bone fractures and lacerations.</p>



<p>There were about 1,060,000 coolers sold in the U.S. from January 2019 through January 2025 that should be replaced, regardless of if they were bought at Costco, Target, Dick&#8217;s, Amazon, Igloo online or elsewhere. Consumers are urged to stop using the product immediately and contact Igloo for a free replacement handle.</p>



<p>The product came in different colors, but all are impacted by this recall &#8212; tactical gray, white, sapphire blue, dark slate blue, carbonite and others. The recall involves products manufactured prior to January 2024, a date that can be found on the bottom of the cooler.</p>

<p>Over 200,000 battery-powered mowers sold nationwide have been recalled due to a fire hazard, the Consumer Product Commission announced on Thursday. </p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2025/TTI-Outdoor-Power-Equipment-Recalls-RYOBI-Battery-Powered-Mowers-Due-to-Fire-Hazard" target="_blank">According to the commission</a>, around 245,900 TTI Outdoor Power Equipment RYOBI 40-Volt Brushless 21 mowers sold in the U.S. and Canada&nbsp;are being recalled because of a push-on connector inside the powerhead that can overheat, the agency said.</p>



<p>The models being recalled are: </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>RY401015BTLUS</li>



<li>RY401015US</li>



<li>RY401150US</li>



<li>RY401150US-Y</li>



<li>RY401020</li>



<li>RY401200</li>
</ul>



<p>The commission has received 97 reports of overheating while in use, including five incidents involving fires and two cases where users suffered minor burn injuries, CPSC said. </p>



<p>In total, 217,500 mowers in the U.S. and 28,400 in Canada are being recalled. The mowers were sold in stores and online at Home Depot and Direct Tools Factory Outlet stores nationwide from February 2021 through January 2025.</p>



<p>The Consumer Product Safety Commission said consumers should stop using the recalled mowers immediately and contact TTI Outdoor Power Equipment Inc. to learn how to disable them and receive a free replacement.</p>

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lg.com/us/" target="_blank">LG</a> has <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/recall-alert" target="_blank">recalled</a> around 500,000 electric ranges following several fires, property damage, and reports of minor injuries and pet deaths.</p>



<p>A <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2025/LG-Recalls-Electric-Ranges-Due-to-Fire-Hazard" target="_blank">posting from the Consumer Product Safety Commission</a> on Thursday said the front-mounted knobs on the recalled ranges can be activated by accidental contact from humans or pets, creating a fire hazard.</p>



<p>The CPSC said it&#8217;s received at least 86 reports of the recalled ranges being accidentally turned on. The ranges have been involved in more than 28 fires, with at least five fires causing over $340,000 in total property damage, according to the CPSC. There have been at least eight reports of minor injuries and three reports of fires involving pet deaths, the CPSC said.</p>



<p>The recall includes 22 models of slide-in and freestanding ranges, according to the CPSC. They were sold from 2015 through January 2025 nationwide at appliance stores like Best Buy, Costco, The Home Depot and Lowe&#8217;s, and online at LG.com. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2025/LG-Recalls-Electric-Ranges-Due-to-Fire-Hazard" target="_blank">CPSC website has a full list of recalled model numbers</a>, which can be found inside the oven door or storage drawer.</p>



<p>Owners of the recalled ranges are instructed to contact LG for a free warning label, which includes a reminder to use the lock out/control lock function. The function, which can be found on the control panel, disables activation of heating elements when the appliance isn&#8217;t being used, according to the CPSC.</p>



<p>Consumers are also advised to keep children and pets away from the ranges, to check that the knobs aren&#8217;t activated before leaving home or going to sleep, and not to leave objects on the ranges when not in use.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>The pet food company Blue Ridge Beef is recalling 5,700 pounds of its two-pound bags of Natural Mix dog food sold in eight states due to a salmonella contamination.</p>



<p>Samples of the dog food collected on Jan. 8 were found to have salmonella bacteria after being tested by the North Carolina Department of Agriculture Food and Drug Protection Laboratory, according to a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/blue-ridge-beef-issues-recall-blue-ridge-beef-natural-mix-due-salmonella-contamination" target="_blank">release by the Food &amp; Drug Administration</a>.</p>



<p>The North Carolina-based Blue Ridge Beef was notified by the FDA on Jan. 27 about the salmonella contamination.</p>



<p>The products were sold between Jan. 3 and Jan. 24 in retail stores in Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, Tennessee and Rhode Island, according to the FDA.</p>



<p>Salmonella infections in pets can cause diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain and decreased appetite, per the FDA. Pets with salmonella infections can also infect other humans and other animals. Anyone whose pet has shown symptoms after consuming the recalled product is urged to contact a veterinarian.</p>



<p>There also is risk to humans of getting a salmonella infection from handling the recalled pet food.</p>



<p>Anyone who did not thoroughly wash their hands after handling the affected dog food or touched surfaces exposed to the product could potentially get a salmonella infection.</p>



<p>It can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramping and fever as well as more serious conditions like arterial infections, endocarditis, arthritis, muscle pain, eye irritation and urinary tract symptoms, according to the FDA.</p>



<p>Anyone who purchased the recalled product is urged to return it or throw it out in a way that it can&#8217;t be accessed by children, pets and wildlife, the FDA advises.</p>



<p>The product should also not be fed to any other animals or donated. Pet food bowls, cups and storage containers should also be washed and sanitized, according to the FDA.</p>

<div class="wp-block-nbc-localized-block">
<p>Recalled items have been sold in New Jersey, Connecticut, Vermont, Massachusetts, California and Virginia. See the full list <a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/tw-garner-food-company-issues-recall-texas-peter-habanero-buffalo-sauce-due-potential-presence" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/tw-garner-food-company-issues-recall-texas-peter-habanero-buffalo-sauce-due-potential-presence">here</a>.</p>

<p>According to the FDA, bottles of the product may contain sriracha sauce, which contains sulfites not listed on the habanero buffalo sauce label. People who are allergic to these sulfites run the risk of serious and potentially life-threatening allergic reactions if consumed. </p>



<p>The impacted products were distributed between Feb. 5 and March 26. The best-by date is located on the top of the side of the 2 fl. oz bottles, on the back label for the 20 oz bottles, on top of the cap for the 12 fl. oz and half gallon jugs.</p>



<p>The company is also recalling select lots and sizes of Texas Pete Sweet CHAbanero Sauce because the bottles fail to contain the labeled ingredient &#8220;aged peppers.&#8221; </p>



<p>No illnesses have been reported to date, according to the FDA. </p>

								<description>
				<![CDATA[
<p>Alarms are being sounded about an old recall after a number of chocolate products sold in several states and online were given a new warning because federal officials said they could “cause serious adverse health consequences or death.”</p>



<p>The FDA announce the<a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/cal-yee-farm-llc-issues-allergy-alert-undeclared-milk-soy-wheat-sesame-fdc-6-and-almonds-snack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> initial recall last year</a> over a list of chocolate items sold from <a href="https://calyeefarm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cal Yee Farm</a>, a company based in California. That original warning marked items like chocolate walnuts, chocolate raisins, chocolate almonds, yogurt coated almonds and chocolate apricots because they may contain undeclared ingredients. Find the full list <a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/cal-yee-farm-llc-issues-allergy-alert-undeclared-milk-soy-wheat-sesame-fdc-6-and-almonds-snack#recall-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p>



<p>According to the recall, the items were sold across nine states, including Pennsylvania, California, Arizona, Virginia, New Mexico, Texas, Tennessee, Oregon and Ohio. The company has an online store as well. </p>



<p>There were no illnesses reported related to the chocolate goods at the time of the recall, the FDA said. </p>



<p>At least three of those products, however, were recently elevated to Class 1 because they contain undeclared milk. That classification is among the highest for the feds and is used to warn consumers of potentially life-threatening concerns. </p>

<p>The FDA says a Class 1 recall is for a &#8220;situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death.&#8221; </p>



<p>The upgraded recall concerns Cal Yee Farm&#8217;s dark chocolate almonds, dark chocolate apricots and dark chocolate Walnuts. </p>



<p>The FDA advised anyone who has purchased any of the recalled items to dispose of them or return them for a full refund. </p>



<p>The California company released a statement in response to the original recall: &#8220;We did a voluntary recall on undeclared milk, soy, wheat, sesame, FD&amp;C #6 and almonds in snack products, due to outdated labels which did not specify allergen statement. Labels are now consistent with known allergens.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.honda.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Honda</a> is voluntarily recalling around 295,000 Acura and Honda vehicles in the U.S. over a risk of engine issues.</p>



<p>The car manufacturer <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hondanews.com/en-US/releases/release-e4e72a01e246a738c5d003060c059b8e-american-honda-recalls-295000-vehicles-in-the-us-to-update-fuel-injection-software" target="_blank">said in a release</a> Wednesday that sudden changes in the throttle of affected vehicles could illuminate the check engine light and cause the engine to hesitate, stall or lose drive power, increasing the risk of a crash or injury.</p>



<p>American Honda said the recalled vehicles have fuel injection electronic control units (FI-ECU) with improper programming, which could lead to the engine problems. The company said it self-diagnosed the issue through the monitoring of telematics information.</p>



<p>The recall includes certain 2023-25 Honda Pilot, 2022-25 Acura MDX Type S and 2021-25 Acura TLX Type S vehicles. Authorized Honda and Acura dealerships will update the FI-ECU software on affected vehicles for free, the company said.</p>



<p>American Honda said it hasn&#8217;t received any confirmed reports of crashes or injuries related to the issue.</p>



<p>&#8220;American Honda is announcing this recall to encourage owners of affected vehicles to take them to an authorized dealer for repair as soon as they receive notification,&#8221; the company said.</p>



<p>Letters notifying owners of affected vehicles are expected to be mailed on March 17, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/search-safety-issues#recall" target="_blank">according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>.</p>



<p>Those looking to confirm whether their vehicle is included in the recall can visit <a href="https://owners.honda.com/service-maintenance/recalls">Recalls.Honda.com</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://owners.acura.com/service-maintenance/recalls" target="_blank">Recalls.Acura.com</a>, or call Honda at 888-234-2138.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Wegmans is recalling frozen chicken nuggets in eight states and the District of Columbia because there may be bone fragments in the packages.</p>



<p>A public health alert was issued for frozen, fully cooked Wegmans breaded chicken breast nuggets by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service, with hopes of making sure customers are aware that they shouldn&#8217;t eat them. A typical recall from the agency wasn&#8217;t issued because the product is no longer for sale.</p>



<p>The alert covers 46 ounce plastic packages containing “Wegmans Family Pack Fully Cooked Breaded Chicken Breast with Rib Meat” with a best if used by date of Aug. 26, 2025. That is located on the back of the packaging next to the barcode in the lower right corner. The product was produced on Aug. 26, 2024.</p>



<p>The nuggets were made for Wegmans Food Markets and distributed in Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>The Food Safety and Inspection Service said that it was notified of the issue after Wegmans received multiple consumer complaints of bone fragments in the product.</p>



<p>There have been no confirmed reports of injury due to consumption. </p>



<p>The Food Safety and Inspection Service said that it is concerned that consumers may still have some of the nugget packages in their freezers. Consumers who still have packages are urged not to eat the product, and to throw it away or return it to the store where it was purchased. </p>



<p>Wegmans said that all packages can be returned for a full refund.</p>



<p>Customers can contact Wegmans Food Markets at 1-855-934-3663 Monday through Friday from 8:00 am to 7:00 pm or Saturday and Sunday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. </p>

<p>Stanley is recalling 2.6 million Switchback and Trigger Action stainless steel travel mugs due to a burn hazard, the Consumer Product Safety Commission says.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2025/Stanley-Recalls-2-6-Million-Switchback-and-Trigger-Action-Travel-Mugs-Due-to-Burn-Hazard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The CPSC said</a> the mugs have a flaw in the lid where the threads can shrink when exposed to heat and torque, causing the lid to detach, open, and pose a burn hazard.</p>



<p>According to the CPSC, Stanley has received 91 reports worldwide, including 16 in the U.S., where the recalled travel mugs’ lids detached during use. The lid failures resulted in 38 people being burned worldwide, including two in the U.S. The CPSC said 11 consumers required medical attention.</p>



<p>The recalled double-walled mugs were sold in various colors, including white, black, and green, in 12 oz., 16 oz., and 20 oz. sizes with a polypropylene lid. The Stanley logo appears on the front and bottom of the mug. A full list of recalled product numbers is below.</p>



<p>The mugs were sold across the United States at various retailers, including Amazon.com, Walmart, Dick’s Sporting Goods, and Target, from June 2016 through December 2024.</p>



<p>Anyone who thinks they may have one of the recalled mugs should look at the bottom of their mug and find the Product Identification Number. If the number matches any of the 11 recalled product numbers below, they should immediately stop using the recalled travel mugs and contact Stanley to receive a free replacement lid.</p>
