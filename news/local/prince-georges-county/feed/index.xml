<p>A recording studio in Brentwood, Maryland, is a little quieter than it used to be.</p>



<p>Lowcation Studios has lost one of its talented audio engineers, Dinari McAlmont, who was found dead shortly after arriving in the Bahamas for vacation.</p>



<p>“I just broke down,” said Oliver Franklin, the owner of Lowcation Studios. “He was, he was really young, and it&#8217;s just, it&#8217;s just devastating.&#8221;</p>



<p>Franklin said McAlmont worked there for the last year producing music.</p>



<p>&#8220;In that year, you know, he was somebody that, you know, I talked to every day,” Franklin said. “You know, he was always obviously in the studio, and it was just crushing.&#8221;</p>



<p>McAlmont and his parents live in Bowie, Maryland. They flew to the Bahamas for vacation Friday.</p>



<p>Less than a day into the trip, his aunt, Marcelle Bacchus, told News4 the 23-year-old was found dead on the beach near his resort, Atlantis Bahamas.</p>



<p>News4 spoke with her by phone.</p>



<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have answers,” Bacchus said. “We don&#8217;t really know, but it&#8217;s very frustrating. Seems as though everything is being pushed under the rug.&#8221;</p>



<p>Bahamian police say an autopsy showed McAlmont drowned, and they do not suspect foul play.</p>



<p>But his family has questions.</p>



<p>The police told them there was some type of issue at a restaurant before McAlmont&#8217;s body was found.</p>



<p>&#8220;They said he spat on someone and ran through a door,&#8221; Bacchus said.</p>



<p>She says his mother told her when she went to see his body, authorities would only show her a photo. She said it looked like McAlmont had been beaten.</p>



<p>They also question why no surveillance video has been released.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just here in the dark,” Bacchus said. “We really need some help, some eyewitness, somebody to come forward and help us to just solve this puzzle.&#8221;</p>



<p>News4 reached out to the resort to help them get some answers. They sent a statement saying, “We are deeply saddened by the passing of one of our guests. Our condolences are with the guest&#8217;s family and loved ones during this difficult time. The police authorities are carrying out an investigation of this tragic incident. We await the police’s findings and will not comment on speculation.”</p>



<p>Bacchus told News4 the family is working to get an international attorney that can help them going forward.</p>



<p>News4 spoke with McAlmont&#8217;s father by phone Wednesday. He is still in the Bahamas. He declined to be interviewed.</p>

<p>For the past two decades, residents of Indian Head, Maryland, had to travel almost 10 miles to pick up their essential groceries, but that changed in the fall when a couple opened a new food market to meet that need in a food desert.</p>



<p>Mark and Marilyn Steele hadn’t planned to own a food market, but they knew the need was severe.</p>



<p>“A grocery store is a cornerstone of a community, and if you want to see a healthy community, you’ve got to have a good store,” Marilyn Steele said.</p>



<p>Indian Head was without a grocery store for almost 25 years.</p>



<p>“I’m like, ‘Oh, my God! That shouldn’t be,’” Marilyn Steel said.</p>



<p>For more than a decade, the town was a federally deemed food desert.</p>



<p>“A lot of folks, they don’t have access to transportation, that just means elderly populations or different income levels, that kind of all feed into that equation,” Indian Head Mayor Brandon Paulin said.</p>



<p>He said work to bring a grocery store to the area started well before he became mayor.</p>



<p>“In 1999, the Super Fresh left the town of Indian Head, and they’re have been many folks, town councils over the years that have tried to address the issue,” Paulin said.</p>



<p>Then the Steeles got involved. They already owned a coffee shop, but the new business venture could serve as an oasis, which is why the store was named Oasis Fresh Foods Market.</p>



<p>The Steeles hope to achieve one goal for their customers.</p>



<p>“I wanted to give everyone a fighting chance at feeding their family well, and that’s what this store represents,” Marilyn Steele said. “You can go from your fresh produce to meats. You can go from canned vegetables to breads. You can go from grab-and-go to prepared foods. It has everything you need to sustain a family well.”</p>

<p>Four weeks after a Maryland father was detained by ICE and wrongfully deported to El Salvador, his wife and lawmakers spoke on Capitol Hill about the urgent need to bring him home.</p>



<p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia was detained on March 12 and flown on a Justice Department flight to a notorious prison – though he had legal status to live in the U.S.</p>



<p>His wife, Jennifer, said Wednesday that her husband’s deportation has destroyed her family’s happiness and their children’s innocence. She fought tears as she spoke on the Hill with Rep. Glenn Ivey and Sen. Chris Van Hollen. </p>



<p>“Kilmar, if you can hear me, I&#8217;m still fighting for you. Your brother, your mother, our children are still fighting for you. We&#8217;re not going to give up hope until the Supreme Court justices do the right thing,” she said.</p>



<p>Some supporters held signs reading “Bring Kilmar home.”</p>



<p>“We are with you in this fight for justice and we demand that Kilmar be returned home now. What has happened should never happen in the United States of America,” Van Hollen said.</p>

<p>Abrego Garcia’s family is awaiting word from the Supreme Court on its decision in his case.</p>



<p>The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to vacate a lower court’s order to release Abrego Garcia from the prison and return him to the U.S.</p>



<p>The solicitor general claimed Judge Paul Xinis did not have the authority to order Abrego Garcia’s release and return.</p>



<p>In their most recent court filing, his attorneys note he has not lived in El Salvador since 2011, when he was just 16. They say he has no criminal record there or here in the U.S.</p>

<p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s deportation and the legal battle that has followed is being seen as a test case on the Trump administration’s deportation authority.</p>



<p>The Supreme Court is weighing arguments from Abrego Garcia’s lawyer and the Trump administration’s lawyer.</p>



<p>In a new filing Tuesday, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued the preliminary injunction filed by Judge Paula Xinis should be vacated because “the court’s order takes the remarkable and unprecedented step of compelling the United States to succeed by 11:59 p.m. yesterday in negotiating Abrego Garcia’s release and return from El Salvador or face contempt.”</p>



<p>Sauer went on to write, “…courts cannot order the Executive to conduct the country’s foreign relations in a particular way because under Article II ‘the transaction of business with foreign nations is executive altogether.’”</p>



<p>Abrego Garcia’s lawyer, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, has argued if the government of El Salvador can give a tour of the prison to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, they can remove Abrego Garcia and send him home. He said he has cases in which ICE has admitted its mistakes and tried to correct them.</p>



<p>“What happened to Kilmar is not out of the ordinary. There have been wrongful deportations in the past and in every prior such case, the United States government has really bent over backwards to fix it, to make it right, to bring the person back,” he said. There is plenty of case law and cases in which this has occurred.”</p>

<p>In a friend of the court brief file with the Supreme Court, three constitutional law professors, including Harvard professor emeritus Laurence Tribe, wrote: “In this case the Executive Branch is effectively asserting absolute, unreviewable authority to remove an individual from the United States even where the removal was in conceded violation of a court order.”</p>



<p>They went on to say, “If the Solicitor General’s argument were correct, the Executive Branch would possess a shuddering degree of power – power that the President could wield in extreme and extraordinary ways, including against American citizens that the President simply disfavors.”</p>

<p>A Maryland woman who found herself in over her head with a fixer-upper turned her frustration into a thriving business – and teaches women home repair skills they never thought they would master.</p>



<p>Tisha Grant’s journey started with trial and error after she got divorced and bought a home.</p>



<p>“I said, ‘I’m going to figure it out. I’m going to try and do some of this stuff myself,’” she said.</p>



<p>Grant watched countless tutorials and got to work.</p>



<p>“I was literally in there hammering everything out, knocking down the walls, pulling out the carpet, because I didn’t have the money to pay,” she said.</p>



<p>She <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thecontract_her/?hl=en">documented her journey on social media</a>. Before she knew it, messages started pouring in.</p>



<p>“People kept asking me questions about, ‘Where did you learn this stuff? How did you learn this? Where can I learn this?’ And I realized there was a hole in the market. There was no place for women, women of color, to learn these types of skills,” she said.</p>



<p>Grant launched <a href="https://www.thecontracther.com/">her company, The ContractHer</a>, and bought herself a pink truck to make sure everyone knew she was driving the business.</p>

<p>She teaches three-day courses to mostly women. Students learn how to tackle home projects, from basic plumbing and electrical work to tiling and painting.</p>



<p>The goal is to give women the confidence and skills they need so they don’t feel dependent on someone else to do the job.</p>



<p>“My other goal is to learn more so I can keep my house up and keep money in my pocket,” student Veronica Moore said.</p>



<p>From self-doubt to self-made success, Grant said she’s living proof that with a little determination and the right tools, anything is possible.</p>



<p>“For most people, especially women, your home is going to be the single greatest investment that you ever have. Why shouldn’t we know how to protect it and upkeep it?” she said.</p>



<p>Learning the skills to tackle home projects can save homeowners thousands of dollars. The average home improvement project costs a little over $8,100 when professionally done, versus about $2,700 to do it yourself, the Census Bureau’s American Housing Survey says.</p>

<p>A federal judge said Friday the government must secure the return of a <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/tag/maryland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince George’s County, Maryland</a>, man who Immigration and Customs Enforcement admitted it deported in error.</p>



<p>More than three weeks after Kilmar Abrego Garcia was detained and flown to a notorious prison in El Salvador, U.S. District Court Judge Paula Xinis ordered that the government return him to the U.S. in about three days, by the end of the day Monday.</p>



<p>The ruling came at the end of a dramatic hearing in which a government lawyer acknowledged to the judge that he couldn&#8217;t make a case for the deportation.</p>



<p>“We concede the facts. The plaintiff should not have been removed,” a Justice Department lawyer said Friday afternoon in court in Greenbelt.</p>



<p>Abrego Garcia, 29, was deported because of an “administrative error,” ICE admitted Monday. The Trump administration went on to accuse Abrego Garcia of being in the gang MS-13, which his family denies.</p>

<p>Xinis asked the government lawyer which documents he could produce showing the government had an arrest warrant for Abrego Garcia or an order of removal.</p>



<p>The lawyer said he could not provide either document but argued there was an order of removal on file.</p>



<p>The judge asked how the detention and deportation process began, and the lawyer said he didn’t know.</p>



<p>Abrego Garcia’s deportation appears to be an illegal act by the government, the judge said. She got the government to concede it had no document showing the Salvadoran government had filed any charges against him.</p>



<p>Xinis found Abrego Garcia had a lawful order to remain in the U.S. that specifically said if the government were to ever remove him from the U.S., he should not be sent to El Salvador.</p>



<p>Abrego Garcia’s wife sat at the defense table. The courtroom was packed with family members, members of clergy, union members and supporters. When the judge issued her ruling, the gallery broke out in applause.</p>



<p>“I want to say thank you to everyone that has helped us, that has supported us in fighting this, and we will continue fighting for Kilmar, for my husband,&#8221; his wife, Jennifer, said.</p>



<div class="wp-block-nbc-html-block html-block"><div id="garcia-time"></div>var pymParent = new pym.Parent('garcia-time', 'https://media.nbcnewyork.com/assets/editorial/national/2025/DC/garcia-timeline/index.html', {title: '', parenturlparam: '', parenturlvalue: ''});</div>



<p>“The thing that was most striking for me about the hearing was that the attorney for the government, who handled the matter very professionally, had so few answers to the judge’s factual questions. Over and over again, he stated that his clients had not provided him with certain information, that his clients had not provided him with certain documents,” defense attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said.</p>



<p>“They’ve spent little effort actually making it right. In fact, I think it’s fair to say they’ve spent no effort whatsoever on making it right,” he continued.</p>



<p>It’s unclear whether the Trump administration will abide by the ruling or file an appeal.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">A sudden detention and disappearance</h2>



<p>Abrego Garcia had just finished his job as a sheet metal worker and was in the car with his young son when ICE pulled him over and detained him.</p>



<p>He was taken to Baltimore and questioned about his alleged ties to MS-13, his wife said in an affidavit. He was then transferred to Louisiana and La Villa, Texas.</p>



<p>Three days after Abrego Garcia was detained, he was flown to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act, ICE confirmed.</p>



<p>His wife spoke to him by phone when he was in the U.S. and tracked his location using ICE’s online detainee locator tool. But when he was flown out of the country, he vanished from the online system and she had no idea where he had been taken.</p>



<p>Finally, she recognized him in a video El Salvador’s president posted to X, showing men in white uniforms being frog-marched and having their heads shaved. In a photo of detainees, she recognized his tattoos.</p>

<p>The government said the order to send Abrego Garcia to El Salvador was an “oversight” and was done “in good faith.”</p>



<p>This week, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the administration’s decision, claimed Abrego Garcia is a gang member and said he will not return to the U.S.</p>



<p>Attorney Lucia Curiel said Friday that he was accused of being in MS-13 in 2019 and was cleared. She spoke about the conversation she had with him then, when she represented him.</p>



<p>“I delivered the news to him that the judge had cleared him of the reckless, false gang allegations and granted him withholding of removal. I told him that that meant he could live in the U.S. legally, and that the government was prohibited from deporting him to El Salvador. I had never seen him smile so much. That news that I told him was true then and it is true now,” she said.</p>



<p>“The basis for that allegation in 2019 was a confidential informant, you know, one of these anonymous tips,” Sandoval-Moshenberg previously said. “There was never any concrete evidence produced.”</p>

<p>Abrego Garcia has lived in the U.S. since 2011. He left El Salvador as he fled gang violence, including gang members who threatened to kill him in an attempt to extort his parents, Sandoval-Moshenberg said.</p>



<p>Abrego Garcia’s wife, lawyers and supporters held a rally Friday morning to call for his release. “Bring Kilmar home,” their signs said.</p>



<p>“Kilmar, if you can hear me … I miss you so much … and I’m doing the best to fight for you and our children,” his wife said.</p>



<p>At the rally, Abrego Garcia’s wife spoke about how much their three kids miss their dad. She said she found their 10-year-old daughter trying to send him messages on her tablet. The little girl said she wished she could trade places with him.</p>

<p>For the past two decades, residents of Indian Head, Maryland, had to travel almost 10 miles to pick up their essential groceries, but that changed in the fall when a couple opened a new food market to meet that need in a food desert.</p>



<p>Mark and Marilyn Steele hadn’t planned to own a food market, but they knew the need was severe.</p>



<p>“A grocery store is a cornerstone of a community, and if you want to see a healthy community, you’ve got to have a good store,” Marilyn Steele said.</p>



<p>Indian Head was without a grocery store for almost 25 years.</p>



<p>“I’m like, ‘Oh, my God! That shouldn’t be,’” Marilyn Steel said.</p>



<p>For more than a decade, the town was a federally deemed food desert.</p>



<p>“A lot of folks, they don’t have access to transportation, that just means elderly populations or different income levels, that kind of all feed into that equation,” Indian Head Mayor Brandon Paulin said.</p>



<p>He said work to bring a grocery store to the area started well before he became mayor.</p>



<p>“In 1999, the Super Fresh left the town of Indian Head, and they’re have been many folks, town councils over the years that have tried to address the issue,” Paulin said.</p>



<p>Then the Steeles got involved. They already owned a coffee shop, but the new business venture could serve as an oasis, which is why the store was named Oasis Fresh Foods Market.</p>



<p>The Steeles hope to achieve one goal for their customers.</p>



<p>“I wanted to give everyone a fighting chance at feeding their family well, and that’s what this store represents,” Marilyn Steele said. “You can go from your fresh produce to meats. You can go from canned vegetables to breads. You can go from grab-and-go to prepared foods. It has everything you need to sustain a family well.”</p>

<p>For the past two decades, residents of Indian Head, Maryland, had to travel almost 10 miles to pick up their essential groceries, but that changed in the fall when a couple opened a new food market to meet that need in a food desert.</p>



<p>Mark and Marilyn Steele hadn’t planned to own a food market, but they knew the need was severe.</p>



<p>“A grocery store is a cornerstone of a community, and if you want to see a healthy community, you’ve got to have a good store,” Marilyn Steele said.</p>



<p>Indian Head was without a grocery store for almost 25 years.</p>



<p>“I’m like, ‘Oh, my God! That shouldn’t be,’” Marilyn Steel said.</p>



<p>For more than a decade, the town was a federally deemed food desert.</p>



<p>“A lot of folks, they don’t have access to transportation, that just means elderly populations or different income levels, that kind of all feed into that equation,” Indian Head Mayor Brandon Paulin said.</p>



<p>He said work to bring a grocery store to the area started well before he became mayor.</p>



<p>“In 1999, the Super Fresh left the town of Indian Head, and they’re have been many folks, town councils over the years that have tried to address the issue,” Paulin said.</p>



<p>Then the Steeles got involved. They already owned a coffee shop, but the new business venture could serve as an oasis, which is why the store was named Oasis Fresh Foods Market.</p>



<p>The Steeles hope to achieve one goal for their customers.</p>



<p>“I wanted to give everyone a fighting chance at feeding their family well, and that’s what this store represents,” Marilyn Steele said. “You can go from your fresh produce to meats. You can go from canned vegetables to breads. You can go from grab-and-go to prepared foods. It has everything you need to sustain a family well.”</p>

<p>Jolene Ivey was expected to be a top candidate in the race to succeed Sen. Angela Alsobrooks for Prince George&#8217;s County executive. She suspended her campaign weeks before the primary and later announced she’s facing health challenges.</p>



<p>In a surprise vote Tuesday, Ivey was voted out as Prince George’s County Council chair and replaced by vice chair Ed Burroughs.</p>



<p>Before that vote, News4 spoke with Ivey about what happened during her campaign for county executive and what’s next for her and the county as it transitions to new leadership.</p>



<p>Ivey had just won reelection to the county council, transitioning from District 5 to an at-large seat, when she entered the county executive race last fall. She quickly received high-profile endorsements from members of Congress and ran TV ads – before the campaign abruptly stopped.</p>



<p>“When I started with the ads, I intended to win,” Ivey said.</p>



<p>“The moment that my doctor called and gave me the come to Jesus moment, I believe the decision was made right then,” she continued.</p>



<p>Ivey’s decision left voters who supported her in shock. Then, last week, she released a statement describing multiple health challenges that she said began as she campaigned, including issues with her lungs and colon that resulted in undereating and losing weight.</p>



<p>Under doctors’ care, Ivey said she’s waiting on a diagnosis.</p>



<p>“One of my doctors told me that I was malnourished,” she said.</p>



<p>Ivey isn’t sure if the pressure of the campaign played a role. </p>



<p>“I can&#8217;t say that it wasn&#8217;t, just because of the timing. I can tell you that I didn&#8217;t internally feel stressed,” she said.</p>

<p>Ivey knows campaigning. The mother of five sons and grandmother was former Maryland attorney general Doug Gansler’s running mate in his unsuccessful bid for governor in 2013. She served as a delegate in the Maryland statehouse, and her son Del. Julian Ivey followed in her footsteps. Her husband, a former Prince George’s County state’s attorney, is Rep. Glenn Ivey. The Iveys have created a political dynasty, serving at three levels of government.</p>



<p>Former Prince George’s County State’s Attorney Aisha Braveboy went on to win the county executive seat and, due to the overwhelmingly Democratic electorate, is the presumptive winner of the June general election.</p>



<p>Ivey chose not to endorse Braveboy after leaving the race but said she supports her.</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m going to help her. I&#8217;ve spoken to her a few times. I&#8217;m gonna help her be as successful as I can,” she said.</p>



<p>Ivey said Braveboy will take office during an “extraordinarily difficult time” for the county, particularly with the loss of federal government jobs under President Donald Trump.</p>



<p>“We have a hiring freeze as a county right now. Things are very tight. I mean, we&#8217;re trying to figure out how to rob Peter to pay Paul right now, and that&#8217;s before you take into account all the people who could soon be losing their jobs,” she said.</p>



<p>News4 asked Ivey if she plans to run for county executive again in a year-and-a-half.</p>



<p>“No, I don&#8217;t. I think that that was my chance and, you know, fate conspired against it, so, it&#8217;s fine,” she said.</p>

<p>While Ivey remains on the council, she lost her chairmanship in a surprise vote. She said she’s committed to remaining on the council and serving her constituents.</p>



<p>“I am determined. I&#8217;m not doing a lot of extra. You might not see me at every community event right now. But I think that people are giving me a lot of grace on that. And I&#8217;ll get there. I&#8217;m getting better. It&#8217;s just gonna take a little time,” she said.</p>



<p>Ivey said she’s not someone who regrets decisions she makes and did not feel emotional about stepping away from the county executive race because of her health. She said she was not expecting to be reelected chair but didn’t expect the vote to happen this week.</p>



<p>She is still a council member at large and said she will run again in 2026.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>For the past two decades, residents of Indian Head, Maryland, had to travel almost 10 miles to pick up their essential groceries, but that changed in the fall when a couple opened a new food market to meet that need in a food desert.</p>



<p>Mark and Marilyn Steele hadn’t planned to own a food market, but they knew the need was severe.</p>



<p>“A grocery store is a cornerstone of a community, and if you want to see a healthy community, you’ve got to have a good store,” Marilyn Steele said.</p>



<p>Indian Head was without a grocery store for almost 25 years.</p>



<p>“I’m like, ‘Oh, my God! That shouldn’t be,’” Marilyn Steel said.</p>



<p>For more than a decade, the town was a federally deemed food desert.</p>



<p>“A lot of folks, they don’t have access to transportation, that just means elderly populations or different income levels, that kind of all feed into that equation,” Indian Head Mayor Brandon Paulin said.</p>



<p>He said work to bring a grocery store to the area started well before he became mayor.</p>



<p>“In 1999, the Super Fresh left the town of Indian Head, and they’re have been many folks, town councils over the years that have tried to address the issue,” Paulin said.</p>



<p>Then the Steeles got involved. They already owned a coffee shop, but the new business venture could serve as an oasis, which is why the store was named Oasis Fresh Foods Market.</p>

<p>For the past two decades, residents of Indian Head, Maryland, had to travel almost 10 miles to pick up their essential groceries, but that changed in the fall when a couple opened a new food market to meet that need in a food desert.</p>



<p>Mark and Marilyn Steele hadn’t planned to own a food market, but they knew the need was severe.</p>



<p>“A grocery store is a cornerstone of a community, and if you want to see a healthy community, you’ve got to have a good store,” Marilyn Steele said.</p>



<p>Indian Head was without a grocery store for almost 25 years.</p>



<p>“I’m like, ‘Oh, my God! That shouldn’t be,’” Marilyn Steel said.</p>



<p>For more than a decade, the town was a federally deemed food desert.</p>



<p>“A lot of folks, they don’t have access to transportation, that just means elderly populations or different income levels, that kind of all feed into that equation,” Indian Head Mayor Brandon Paulin said.</p>



<p>He said work to bring a grocery store to the area started well before he became mayor.</p>



<p>“In 1999, the Super Fresh left the town of Indian Head, and they’re have been many folks, town councils over the years that have tried to address the issue,” Paulin said.</p>



<p>Then the Steeles got involved. They already owned a coffee shop, but the new business venture could serve as an oasis, which is why the store was named Oasis Fresh Foods Market.</p>



<p>The Steeles hope to achieve one goal for their customers.</p>



<p>“I wanted to give everyone a fighting chance at feeding their family well, and that’s what this store represents,” Marilyn Steele said. “You can go from your fresh produce to meats.

<p>“A lot of folks, they don’t have access to transportation, that just means elderly populations or different income levels, that kind of all feed into that equation,” Indian Head Mayor Brandon Paulin said.</p>



<p>He said work to bring a grocery store to the area started well before he became mayor.</p>



<p>“In 1999, the Super Fresh left the town of Indian Head, and they’re have been many folks, town councils over the years that have tried to address the issue,” Paulin said.</p>



<p>Then the Steeles got involved. They already owned a coffee shop, but the new business venture could serve as an oasis, which is why the store was named Oasis Fresh Foods Market.</p>



<p>The Steeles hope to achieve one goal for their customers.</p>



<p>“I wanted to give everyone a fighting chance at feeding their family well, and that’s what this store represents,” Marilyn Steele said. “You can go from your fresh produce to meats. You can go from canned vegetables to breads. You can go from grab-and-go to prepared foods. It has everything you need to sustain a family well.”</p>

<p>For the past two decades, residents of Indian Head, Maryland, had to travel almost 10 miles to pick up their essential groceries, but that changed in the fall when a couple opened a new food market to meet that need in a food desert.</p>



<p>Mark and Marilyn Steele hadn’t planned to own a food market, but they knew the need was severe.</p>



<p>“A grocery store is a cornerstone of a community, and if you want to see a healthy community, you’ve got to have a good store,” Marilyn Steele said.</p>



<p>Indian Head was without a grocery store for almost 25 years.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>For the past two decades, residents of Indian Head, Maryland, had to travel almost 10 miles to pick up their essential groceries, but that changed in the fall when a couple opened a new food market to meet that need in a food desert.</p>



<p>Mark and Marilyn Steele hadn’t planned to own a food market, but they knew the need was severe.</p>



<p>“A grocery store is a cornerstone of a community, and if you want to see a healthy community, you’ve got to have a good store,” Marilyn Steele said.</p>



<p>Indian Head was without a grocery store for almost 25 years.</p>



<p>“I’m like, ‘Oh, my God! That shouldn’t be,’” Marilyn Steel said.</p>



<p>For more than a decade, the town was a federally deemed food desert.</p>



<p>“A lot of folks, they don’t have access to transportation, that just means elderly populations or different income levels, that kind of all feed into that equation,” Indian Head Mayor Brandon Paulin said.</p>



<p>He said work to bring a grocery store to the area started well before he became mayor.</p>



<p>“In 1999, the Super Fresh left the town of Indian Head, and they’re have been many folks, town councils over the years that have tried to address the issue,” Paulin said.</p>



<p>Then the Steeles got involved. They already owned a coffee shop, but the new business venture could serve as an oasis, which is why the store was named Oasis Fresh Foods Market.</p>



<p>The Steeles hope to achieve one goal for their customers.</p>



<p>“I wanted to give everyone a fighting chance at feeding their family well, and that’s what this store represents,” Marilyn Steele said. “You can go from your fresh produce to meats. You can go from canned vegetables to breads. You can go from grab-and-go to prepared foods. It has everything you need to sustain a family well.”</p>

<p>For the past two decades, residents of Indian Head, Maryland, had to travel almost 10 miles to pick up their essential groceries, but that changed in the fall when a couple opened a new food market to meet that need in a food desert.</p>



<p>Mark and Marilyn Steele hadn’t planned to own a food market, but they knew the need was severe.</p>



<p>“A grocery store is a cornerstone of a community, and if you want to see a healthy community, you’ve got to have a good store,” Marilyn Steele said.</p>



<p>Indian Head was without a grocery store for almost 25 years.</p>



<p>“I’m like, ‘Oh, my God! That shouldn’t be,’” Marilyn Steel said.</p>



<p>For more than a decade, the town was a federally deemed food desert.</p>



<p>“A lot of folks, they don’t have access to transportation, that just means elderly populations or different income levels, that kind of all feed into that equation,” Indian Head Mayor Brandon Paulin said.</p>



<p>He said work to bring a grocery store to the area started well before he became mayor.</p>



<p>“In 1999, the Super Fresh left the town of Indian Head, and they’re have been many folks, town councils over the years that have tried to address the issue,” Paulin said.</p>



<p>Then the Steeles got involved. They already owned a coffee shop, but the new business venture could serve as an oasis, which is why the store was named Oasis Fresh Foods Market.</p>



<p>The Steeles hope to achieve one goal for their customers.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Prince George&#8217;s County Council and school board members held an emergency &#8220;state of the schools&#8221; town hall Tuesday night to address community concerns.</p>



<p>The meeting comes after several violent incidents at county schools over the past eight months.</p>



<p>Last June, Potomac High School in Oxon Hill became a deadly crime scene, when a 33-year-old man was shot and killed at a football fundraiser. A 5-year-old boy was injured.</p>



<p>In September 2024, someone fired shots near a group of Gwynn Park High School students as they waited for their school bus along Livingston Road in Accokeek. No one was hit, but police say the shooters robbed some of the students of their shoes.</p>



<p>Just two weeks ago, High Point High School in Beltsville was on lockdown for hours after a report of someone armed with a gun. It all stemmed from a fight between multiple students. Video obtained by News4 shows someone running toward the school with what appeared to be a handgun in his hand. Police, however, did not find a gun.</p>



<p>Now, one mother is demanding action after she said her child was attacked in school.</p>



<p>“My child still hasn&#8217;t got justice from being brutally attacked in a utility closet,” Juanita Caldwell said.</p>



<p>Caldwell said the past three months have been a nightmare for her daughter.</p>



<p>“They ruined my baby’s first year of high school. They ruined my child’s first year of high school…” she said. “It’s just been traumatic. We didn&#8217;t get to enjoy Christmas, we didn&#8217;t get to enjoy new year.”</p>



<p>Back in December, the 14-year-old freshman was assaulted by a group of students at Potomac High School. Caldwell said the attack left scars that may never go away.</p>



<p>“I pulled my child out of school, all the way out of school,” she said. “She’s currently doing online school at this time, and she physically has recovered, but she still is being bullied by these same children.”</p>



<p>That’s why she joined dozens of concerned community members for this emergency state of schools town hall at the William Beanes Community Center.</p>

<p>District 7 Council Member Krystal Oriadha hosted the panel with the sheriff, superintendent and several board members to answer questions about how local leaders are working to keep students safe.</p>



<p>“Being a new mom myself, I couldn&#8217;t imagine feeling like my child wasn&#8217;t safe, and I would do anything and advocate for them, so I truly understand…” Oriadha said. “And so that’s why this was important to me. I have the position to bring the stakeholders to the table.”</p>



<p>Before the Q &amp; A, school leaders touched on how recent executive orders will impact federal funding for the school district and immigration policy, as well as mental health services that are available to students.</p>



<p>“Potomac [High School] is a death trap…” Caldwell said.</p>



<p>She said she will have to see some big changes before she sends her daughter back.</p>



<p>“I want to see some action because all of our children are in danger, not just my child,&#8221; she said. </p>



<p>The county does have a task force for truancy and another for gun violence, but Oriadha says going forward she would like to set up a working group of parents and local leaders that specifically focuses on school safety.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Prince George&#8217;s County Council Chair Jolene Ivey unexpectedly dropped out of the race for county executive Wednesday.</p>



<p>Ivey was considered a leading candidate in the race to replace former County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, who now serves in the U.S. Senate.</p>



<p>In a statement posted to her Facebook page today, Ivey said: &#8220;I want to thank all of my volunteers and supporters for standing with me. I look forward to continue fighting for the people of Prince George’s County as a member of the County Council.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ivey suspended her campaign just weeks before a March 4 primary election.</p>



<p>She was among several well-known names in Prince George&#8217;s County campaigning for the job.</p>



<p>Internal polling consistently placed her in the top five likely to succeed Alsobrooks. The others are Prince George&#8217;s County State&#8217;s Attorney Aisha Braveboy, former County Executive Rushern Baker, at-large Council member Calvin Hawkins and Maryland state Sen. Alonzo Washington.</p>



<p>The race also includes Tonya Sweat, Marcellus Crews, Ron Hunt, Albert Slocum and Jonathan White.</p>



<p>The general election is scheduled for June.</p>

<p>For the past two decades, residents of Indian Head, Maryland, had to travel almost 10 miles to pick up their essential groceries, but that changed in the fall when a couple opened a new food market to meet that need in a food desert.</p>



<p>Mark and Marilyn Steele hadn’t planned to own a food market, but they knew the need was severe.</p>



<p>“A grocery store is a cornerstone of a community, and if you want to see a healthy community, you’ve got to have a good store,” Marilyn Steele said.</p>



<p>Indian Head was without a grocery store for almost 25 years.</p>



<p>“I’m like, ‘Oh, my God! That shouldn’t be,’” Marilyn Steel said.</p>



<p>For more than a decade, the town was a federally deemed food desert.</p>



<p>“A lot of folks, they don’t have access to transportation, that just means elderly populations or different income levels, that kind of all feed into that equation,” Indian Head Mayor Brandon Paulin said.</p>



<p>He said work to bring a grocery store to the area started well before he became mayor.</p>



<p>“In 1999, the Super Fresh left the town of Indian Head, and they’re have been many folks, town councils over the years that have tried to address the issue,” Paulin said.</p>



<p>Then the Steeles got involved. They already owned a coffee shop, but the new business venture could serve as an oasis, which is why the store was named Oasis Fresh Foods Market.</p>



<p>The Steeles hope to achieve one goal for their customers.</p>



<p>“I wanted to give everyone a fighting chance at feeding their family well, and that’s what this store represents,” Marilyn Steele said. “You can go from your fresh produce to meats. You can go from canned vegetables to breads. You can go from grab-and-go to prepared foods. It has everything you need to sustain a family well.”</p>

<p>For the past two decades, residents of Indian Head, Maryland, had to travel almost 10 miles to pick up their essential groceries, but that changed in the fall when a couple opened a new food market to meet that need in a food desert.</p>



<p>Mark and Marilyn Steele hadn’t planned to own a food market, but they knew the need was severe.</p>



<p>“A grocery store is a cornerstone of a community, and if you want to see a healthy community, you’ve got to have a good store,” Marilyn Steele said.</p>



<p>Indian Head was without a grocery store for almost 25 years.</p>



<p>“I’m like, ‘Oh, my God! That shouldn’t be,’” Marilyn Steel said.</p>



<p>For more than a decade, the town was a federally deemed food desert.</p>



<p>“A lot of folks, they don’t have access to transportation, that just means elderly populations or different income levels, that kind of all feed into that equation,” Indian Head Mayor Brandon Paulin said.</p>



<p>He said work to bring a grocery store to the area started well before he became mayor.</p>



<p>“In 1999, the Super Fresh left the town of Indian Head, and they’re have been many folks, town councils over the years that have tried to address the issue,” Paulin said.</p>



<p>Then the Steeles got involved. They already owned a coffee shop, but the new business venture could serve as an oasis, which is why the store was named Oasis Fresh Foods Market.</p>



<p>The Steeles hope to achieve one goal for their customers.</p>



<p>“I wanted to give everyone a fighting chance at feeding their family well, and that’s what this store represents,” Marilyn Steele said. “You can go from your fresh produce to meats. You can go from canned vegetables to breads. You can go from grab-and-go to prepared foods. It has everything you need to sustain a family well.”</p>
