The city frustrating and unfair. The city just restarted a pilot program just restarted a pilot program aimed at helping the I-Team aimed at helping the I-Team tracked the city\u2019s first efforts tracked the city\u2019s first efforts in that program, and found out in that program, and found out it cost DC Taxpayers more than it cost DC Taxpayers more than 600. Excuse me, $600 per ride. 600. Excuse me, $600 per ride. Per taxi ride. That\u2019s provided. Per taxi ride. That\u2019s provided.

Ted Oberg and the I-Team went Ted Oberg and the I-Team went looking for answers. It says looking for answers. It says assigning driver on the assigning driver on the afternoon we caught up with afternoon we caught up with Kelly Mack. She just needed a Kelly Mack. She just needed a ride to the grocery store.

Max used a wheelchair since she was ten, wheelchair since she was ten, moved to DC after college, she moved to DC after college, she tells us, because our city was tells us, because our city was trying to be more accessible. trying to be more accessible. Are they keeping the promise? So Are they keeping the promise? So here and there? It\u2019s not exactly here and there? It\u2019s not exactly the city\u2019s motto. It\u2019s hard. DC the city\u2019s motto. It\u2019s hard. DC Has a few options for passengers Has a few options for passengers with wheelchairs. Metro is with wheelchairs. Metro is accessible. Metro access works, accessible. Metro access works, too, but requires setting up too, but requires setting up rides days in advance and being rides days in advance and being willing to wait. The transport willing to wait. The transport DC Program offers subsidized DC Program offers subsidized taxi rides, but only within the taxi rides, but only within the district. The district doesn\u2019t district. The district doesn\u2019t require rideshare companies like require rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft to have wheelchair Uber and Lyft to have wheelchair accessible vehicles, and they accessible vehicles, and they account for 95% of all the for account for 95% of all the for hire rides here, which leaves hire rides here, which leaves taxis. They make up just 5% of taxis. They make up just 5% of all the for hire trips in DC Did all the for hire trips in DC Did they have someone? They didn\u2019t they have someone? They didn\u2019t have anyone yet. Taxis are have anyone yet. Taxis are district regulated and provided district regulated and provided 23,000 trips for people who use 23,000 trips for people who use wheelchairs last year. Riders wheelchairs last year. Riders like Kelly tell us wheelchair like Kelly tell us wheelchair accessible taxis are not exactly accessible taxis are not exactly plentiful when you need one. I plentiful when you need one. I call it the Yeti because it\u2019s call it the Yeti because it\u2019s rumored to exist, but you know, rumored to exist, but you know, I rarely ever see it. Which is I rarely ever see it. Which is why the district, with every why the district, with every good intention, has tried to good intention, has tried to increase service. DC Has a law increase service. DC Has a law mandating 20% of large cab mandating 20% of large cab fleets have to be wheelchair fleets have to be wheelchair accessible, but the I-Team accessible, but the I-Team couldn\u2019t find that it\u2019s ever couldn\u2019t find that it\u2019s ever been enforced. And the head of been enforced. And the head of the department with oversight the department with oversight told us we can\u2019t punish them told us we can\u2019t punish them into compliance. There really, into compliance. There really, really needs to be progress. really needs to be progress. Naomi Hesse was hopeful last Naomi Hesse was hopeful last year when DC Set aside 500,000 year when DC Set aside 500,000 more of your dollars to more of your dollars to incentivize cab drivers to incentivize cab drivers to operate wheelchair accessible operate wheelchair accessible vehicles, paying those drivers vehicles, paying those drivers more per hour or to work late more per hour or to work late hours. The city even set up a hours. The city even set up a hotline for people to get hotline for people to get connected. I tried that pilot connected. I tried that pilot line multiple times and they line multiple times and they just couldn\u2019t find one for me. just couldn\u2019t find one for me. Where is the money going? The Where is the money going? The district spent $255,000 in that district spent $255,000 in that pilot program, which generated pilot program, which generated 435 wheelchair taxi trips over 435 wheelchair taxi trips over six months. That\u2019s $586.21 per six months. That\u2019s $586.21 per ride. Not exactly a return on ride. Not exactly a return on investment to brag about. investment to brag about. Jonathan Rogers, the director of Jonathan Rogers, the director of DC\u2019s Department of for hire DC\u2019s Department of for hire vehicles, which spearheaded the vehicles, which spearheaded the pilot, wouldn\u2019t talk to us on pilot, wouldn\u2019t talk to us on camera, but he told the I-Team camera, but he told the I-Team Council, encouraged us to Council, encouraged us to experiment and figure out what experiment and figure out what would change behavior. So that\u2019s would change behavior. So that\u2019s what we did. He said he hoped it what we did. He said he hoped it would build momentum and that would build momentum and that the six new drivers added to the the six new drivers added to the program would stick with it. program would stick with it. Anyone without a wheelchair can Anyone without a wheelchair can get an Uber, Lyft or taxi get an Uber, Lyft or taxi whenever they want. It\u2019s just whenever they want. It\u2019s just not fair. Last fall, Naomi Hesse not fair. Last fall, Naomi Hesse had all her travel planned out had all her travel planned out so she could attend the Sabrina so she could attend the Sabrina Carpenter concert in Baltimore, Carpenter concert in Baltimore, but a delayed Amtrak train got but a delayed Amtrak train got her to Union Station at one in her to Union Station at one in the morning, leaving her with the morning, leaving her with few options. I was forced to few options. I was forced to walk home alone in the middle of walk home alone in the middle of the night. She says. It isn\u2019t the night. She says. It isn\u2019t like this everywhere in New York like this everywhere in New York City, there are more than 12,000 City, there are more than 12,000 wheelchair accessible taxis and wheelchair accessible taxis and rideshare vehicles. That city rideshare vehicles. That city says 46% of their taxi fleet is says 46% of their taxi fleet is wheelchair accessible. And by wheelchair accessible. And by law, anyone who now wants to law, anyone who now wants to start driving for a rideshare start driving for a rideshare company there must use an company there must use an accessible vehicle. Here in D.C, accessible vehicle. Here in D.C, Uber has a few, but didn\u2019t Uber has a few, but didn\u2019t respond to any of our questions respond to any of our questions about wheelchair vehicles. Lyft about wheelchair vehicles. Lyft has none in D.C, but does offer has none in D.C, but does offer them in nine other cities. They them in nine other cities. They told the I-Team it will continue told the I-Team it will continue to push for solutions that make to push for solutions that make rideshare as accessible as rideshare as accessible as possible for everyone. This one possible for everyone. This one needs a transmission. This one needs a transmission. This one needs a transmission. As for needs a transmission. As for taxis, none of the larger taxis, none of the larger companies in town would talk to companies in town would talk to us on camera, but did admit it us on camera, but did admit it is a challenge saying wheelchair is a challenge saying wheelchair accessible taxis are both accessible taxis are both expensive to buy and costly to expensive to buy and costly to maintain due mostly to their maintain due mostly to their weight and modifications, which weight and modifications, which could explain why we found so could explain why we found so many in their lots. Do you have many in their lots. Do you have an estimated time for riders an estimated time for riders like Kelly Mack, who just wants like Kelly Mack, who just wants to get to the store? It all to get to the store? It all feels pretty isolating. I had 72 feels pretty isolating. I had 72 attempted trips. So frustrating. attempted trips. So frustrating. She started tracking every taxi She started tracking every taxi call she made for the last three call she made for the last three years. 71% failure rate, which years. 71% failure rate, which is exactly what happened on the is exactly what happened on the day we spent with her. Well, we day we spent with her. Well, we a few more minutes and then a few more minutes and then probably gear up, put on the probably gear up, put on the coat, head out. She is upbeat, coat, head out. She is upbeat, but it was so frustrating to but it was so frustrating to watch, knowing almost three watch, knowing almost three quarters of the time this quarters of the time this doesn\u2019t work for her. DC\u2019s doesn\u2019t work for her. DC\u2019s Department of For-hire vehicles Department of For-hire vehicles told us it is offering more told us it is offering more incentives in a new version of incentives in a new version of the pilot program, launched just the pilot program, launched just a short time ago, and they\u2019ll be a short time ago, and they\u2019ll be sending letters to all taxi sending letters to all taxi companies asking for their long companies asking for their long term plans to address this term plans to address this shortage.

The grim estimate $5,000 a year. The grim estimate renewing fears tonight that renewing fears tonight that higher prices are on the way higher prices are on the way with the industrial, retail, with the industrial, retail, consumer and automotive sectors consumer and automotive sectors all feeling the pain. Well, all feeling the pain. Well, today we spoke with personal today we spoke with personal finance columnist with The finance columnist with The Washington Post who acknowledged Washington Post who acknowledged the fears people are having and the fears people are having and offered some advice. What I\u2019m offered some advice. What I\u2019m not going to tell people to do not going to tell people to do is, can I use a double negative, is, can I use a double negative, not panic? Go ahead and panic not panic? Go ahead and panic are scream, cry. It is a scary are scream, cry. It is a scary day for regular people who have day for regular people who have spent their lives trying to spent their lives trying to save, to send their kids to save, to send their kids to college or retirement and to see college or retirement and to see the markets drop the way they the markets drop the way they have on a policy that many have on a policy that many economists thinks is wrong. It economists thinks is wrong. It just it hurts your heart. It just it hurts your heart. It hurts your head. So I please hurts your head. So I please feel what you need to feel. But feel what you need to feel. But don\u2019t act on those fears, don\u2019t act on those fears, particularly if you have a long particularly if you have a long time before you need that money time before you need that money that is invested. So what should that is invested. So what should you do? I\u2019m joined now by Jacob you do? I\u2019m joined now by Jacob Cherubini, an executive of Cherubini, an executive of residence at finance at Loyola residence at finance at Loyola University Maryland. Jason, many University Maryland. Jason, many of us are regularly contributing of us are regularly contributing to our 401 s and retirement to our 401 s and retirement savings plans. We know the best savings plans. We know the best advice is usually to ride it advice is usually to ride it out, but should people out, but should people reconsider just how much they reconsider just how much they contribute to those plans right contribute to those plans right now? Amid all this uncertainty? now? Amid all this uncertainty? It\u2019s not that you want to reduce It\u2019s not that you want to reduce your contribution. You still your contribution. You still want to get it in there as much want to get it in there as much as you can for all of the tax as you can for all of the tax benefits that are there. The go benefits that are there. The go to advice, as you said, really to advice, as you said, really is to try to ride it out. is to try to ride it out. Looking at what happened in the Looking at what happened in the market today, this drop of 4 to market today, this drop of 4 to 6%, depending on what market 6%, depending on what market you\u2019re looking at, is big. It you\u2019re looking at, is big. It would be you can\u2019t say anything would be you can\u2019t say anything else about it. But since 1950 else about it. But since 1950 this has happened 56 times. So this has happened 56 times. So three out of four years we do three out of four years we do see something like this. This see something like this. This isn\u2019t necessarily unprecedented. isn\u2019t necessarily unprecedented. I think the best thing for I think the best thing for people to do, looking at what people to do, looking at what and when they need the money and when they need the money for, ride it out if possible, for, ride it out if possible, and possibly rebalance their and possibly rebalance their portfolio as new information is portfolio as new information is coming in. Boy, that\u2019s quite a coming in. Boy, that\u2019s quite a perspective. 56 times. That\u2019s perspective. 56 times. That\u2019s that\u2019s comforting, I guess, in that\u2019s comforting, I guess, in the big picture of things. the big picture of things. Jason, let\u2019s talk about prices Jason, let\u2019s talk about prices not just for cars, but everyday not just for cars, but everyday items too. How long before we items too. How long before we see changes when we\u2019re out see changes when we\u2019re out shopping? And should we be shopping? And should we be worried about price gouging worried about price gouging right now? I\u2019m not sure price right now? I\u2019m not sure price gouging is really going to come gouging is really going to come in. We still have the supply in. We still have the supply chain going. We still have chain going. We still have products coming in, but we products coming in, but we should expect to see prices should expect to see prices going up depending on the goods going up depending on the goods you purchase. As you had the you purchase. As you had the infographic up there, an average infographic up there, an average of about 5000 per family, of about 5000 per family, depending on the study. Yale depending on the study. Yale Economics Lab said on the low Economics Lab said on the low end, it would be about 1200. For end, it would be about 1200. For high spenders, it could be as high spenders, it could be as much as 8000. So I think people much as 8000. So I think people should look at their budgets, should look at their budgets, where they\u2019re spending money and where they\u2019re spending money and have plans for any of those have plans for any of those larger purchases, which may have larger purchases, which may have an increased price with it, an increased price with it, especially things like especially things like automobiles, computers or other automobiles, computers or other goods that are definitely going goods that are definitely going to be impacted by these tariffs. to be impacted by these tariffs. And Jason, you already touched And Jason, you already touched on this a bit, but today was on this a bit, but today was obviously not a good day on Wall obviously not a good day on Wall Street. But it is just one day Street. But it is just one day for someone like you who\u2019s for someone like you who\u2019s fluent in this financial world fluent in this financial world and these figures that we\u2019re and these figures that we\u2019re talking about, when does real talking about, when does real concern set in? Are there red concern set in? Are there red flags or or signs of flags or or signs of encouragement that you\u2019re encouragement that you\u2019re looking for now? Well, I think looking for now? Well, I think as we look at the market as a as we look at the market as a whole and looking for those red whole and looking for those red flags, as you said, it\u2019s not in flags, as you said, it\u2019s not in a one day reaction on the stock a one day reaction on the stock market. Stock prices move with market. Stock prices move with emotion, really driven by fear emotion, really driven by fear and greed. And with so much and greed. And with so much news, so much negative news on news, so much negative news on all of these tariffs coming out, all of these tariffs coming out, there was a lot of reaction to there was a lot of reaction to that. I think the bigger concern that. I think the bigger concern is looking at what this is going is looking at what this is going to do to the economy as a whole. to do to the economy as a whole. Goldman Sachs recently upped the Goldman Sachs recently upped the chance of a recession from about chance of a recession from about 20% to 35%. And seeing that we 20% to 35%. And seeing that we are going to see a slowdown in are going to see a slowdown in GDP from about 2.4%, that was GDP from about 2.4%, that was the estimate down to about 1.7%. the estimate down to about 1.7%. So I think those longer term So I think those longer term effects, if they come to effects, if they come to fruition, would be the bigger fruition, would be the bigger negative side. All right. So negative side. All right. So interesting, Jason Cherubini interesting, Jason Cherubini from Loyola University in from Loyola University in Maryland. Thank you so much for Maryland. Thank you so much for your time and all your insights your time and all your insights and perspectives. We really and perspectives. We really appreciate it tonight. Thank appreciate it tonight.

It special agreement with Ice. It will give federal agents more will give federal agents more time to pick up people who have time to pick up people who have Ice detainers. But tonight, as Ice detainers. But tonight, as Northern Virginia bureau chief Northern Virginia bureau chief Julie Carey explains, the new Julie Carey explains, the new policy is already getting policy is already getting pushback from some community pushback from some community groups. Deportation. We\u2019re not groups. Deportation. We\u2019re not that kind of nation. that kind of nation. Demonstrators calling on Loudoun Demonstrators calling on Loudoun Sheriff Mike Chapman to pull out Sheriff Mike Chapman to pull out of a new agreement with Ice, of a new agreement with Ice, saying it betrays the public saying it betrays the public trust. It concerns me because trust.

And I think that it could be And I think that it could be very much a slippery slope. I very much a slippery slope. I think there\u2019s much to do about think there\u2019s much to do about not a whole lot here, quite not a whole lot here, quite frankly. The memo of agreement frankly. The memo of agreement signed last week means a change signed last week means a change inside the Loudoun County Jail. inside the Loudoun County Jail. Unlike some other Northern Unlike some other Northern Virginia jurisdictions, Loudoun Virginia jurisdictions, Loudoun jail officials always notify Ice jail officials always notify Ice when someone with an Ice when someone with an Ice detainer is about to be detainer is about to be released. Under past policy, Ice released. Under past policy, Ice must come pick up that person on must come pick up that person on the day of release and often the day of release and often can\u2019t make it in time. can\u2019t make it in time. Typically, they would come out Typically, they would come out for people that have committed for people that have committed the more serious crimes, not the more serious crimes, not something minor. In the last six something minor. In the last six months of 2024, there were Ice months of 2024, there were Ice detainers on 245 Loudoun jail detainers on 245 Loudoun jail inmates, but Ice only picked up inmates, but Ice only picked up 99. So far this year, there have 99. So far this year, there have been 80 detairs, but slightly been 80 detairs, but slightly more than half picked up under more than half picked up under the new agreement. A small the new agreement. A small number of jail deputies, about number of jail deputies, about 10 to 20, will get special 10 to 20, will get special training from Ice and become training from Ice and become warrant service officers. It warrant service officers. It gives them the ability to serve gives them the ability to serve the Ice detainer on the subject. the Ice detainer on the subject. So instead of getting a day or So instead of getting a day or less to show up. Ice will now less to show up. Ice will now get 48 hours. It\u2019s good for us get 48 hours. It\u2019s good for us because if we have to release because if we have to release them and they\u2019re a danger to our them and they\u2019re a danger to our community, that only adds to, community, that only adds to, you know, community, the lack of you know, community, the lack of safety in the community. So we safety in the community. So we need to make sure we\u2019re doing need to make sure we\u2019re doing everything we can to keep our everything we can to keep our citizens safe. And this will citizens safe. And this will actually help us quite a bit. actually help us quite a bit. But opponents of the plan warn But opponents of the plan warn it will make Loudoun less safe, it will make Loudoun less safe, increasing fear in the immigrant increasing fear in the immigrant community, leading to reluctance community, leading to reluctance to report crime. We are to report crime. We are concerned that this will concerned that this will undermine trust between our undermine trust between our community members and police. community members and police. Former prosecutor, now defense Former prosecutor, now defense attorney Ryan Ruzek, also attorney Ryan Ruzek, also worries what the longer holding worries what the longer holding time. Ice will be able to pick time. Ice will be able to pick up more people, even those up more people, even those involved in minor offenses. It involved in minor offenses. It makes a huge difference in the makes a huge difference in the number of people that would be number of people that would be affected. And when the community affected. And when the community understands that, it will make a understands that, it will make a difference in who reaches out to difference in who reaches out to the police and who is too afraid the police and who is too afraid to. The sheriff says the online to. The sheriff says the online ice training of the deputies in ice training of the deputies in the jail should be completed in the jail should be completed in the next couple of weeks, and the next couple of weeks, and then the new policy will be in then the new policy will be in force in Loudoun County.

You never knew what genre Scene. You never knew what genre of material was going to pop up, of material was going to pop up, and somehow the band always made and somehow the band always made it work in an acoustic bluegrass it work in an acoustic bluegrass context.

The we\u2019re the ones doing it. The band knows every time they take band knows every time they take the stage, they\u2019re representing the stage, they\u2019re representing the previous generations of the the previous generations of the Seldom Scene who went before Seldom Scene who went before them. Clay Hess, the youngest them. Clay Hess, the youngest member of the band, was born the member of the band, was born the year of the original Seldom year of the original Seldom Scene started.

It\u2019s not just a band, and it\u2019s bigger than the band, and it\u2019s bigger than the sum of its parts, you know? And sum of its parts, you know? And that\u2019s true. I just I hope it that\u2019s true. I just I hope it goes on and on and on and on and goes on and on and on and on and on. As for how long there will on. As for how long there will be a seldom scene. Who knows, be a seldom scene. Who knows, maybe forever. It can go on maybe forever. It can go on forever, as far as I\u2019m forever, as far as I\u2019m concerned. I think we have a concerned. I think we have a license to carry on, and so license to carry on, and so that\u2019s what we did. The songs that\u2019s what we did. The songs are too good not to be sung and are too good not to be sung and not to be heard. They won\u2019t die not to be heard. They won\u2019t die if you keep doing them. So if you keep doing them.

The 110 acres Anacostia River. The 110 acres known as Poplar Point. Mark known as Poplar Point. Mark Segraves takes a look at what Segraves takes a look at what the city has planned for that the city has planned for that land, stretching along the east land, stretching along the east bank of the Anacostia River bank of the Anacostia River across from Nats Park, nestled across from Nats Park, nestled between the Frederick Douglass between the Frederick Douglass and 11th Street bridges sits 110 and 11th Street bridges sits 110 acres of mostly wooded park and acres of mostly wooded park and wetlands. Much like the RFK wetlands. Much like the RFK campus, Poplar Point is federal campus, Poplar Point is federal land that Congress has land that Congress has transferred control of to the transferred control of to the district. Nina Albert, DC\u2019s district. Nina Albert, DC\u2019s deputy mayor for economic deputy mayor for economic development, walked us through development, walked us through the plans to develop Poplar the plans to develop Poplar Point, starting with the Point, starting with the requirement that most of the 110 requirement that most of the 110 acres remains parkland. We will acres remains parkland. We will have a 70 acre waterfront park have a 70 acre waterfront park and 40 acres of development. and 40 acres of development. Anacostia waterfront is Anacostia waterfront is approximately 1200 acres of approximately 1200 acres of natural and open green space natural and open green space along the Anacostia. I don\u2019t along the Anacostia. I don\u2019t think people realize that it think people realize that it rivals Rock Creek Park in terms rivals Rock Creek Park in terms of environmental and natural of environmental and natural assets. Part of the assets. Part of the redevelopment of Poplar Point redevelopment of Poplar Point includes preserving 70 acres of includes preserving 70 acres of open and green space, and I open and green space, and I think it\u2019s going to be a real think it\u2019s going to be a real world class natural amenity and world class natural amenity and provide access to the river in a provide access to the river in a way that other parts of our way that other parts of our waterfront development have not waterfront development have not been able to. Albert\u2019s office been able to. Albert\u2019s office has begun a series of community has begun a series of community meetings previewing the three meetings previewing the three alternatives under alternatives under consideration, including the consideration, including the possibility of a large anchor possibility of a large anchor tenant right on the point that tenant right on the point that would draw crowds. Yeah, I think would draw crowds. Yeah, I think that the point is a logical that the point is a logical place. It\u2019s also directly across place. It\u2019s also directly across from the Yards and Nats from the Yards and Nats ballpark, and so there\u2019s a ballpark, and so there\u2019s a natural synergy of having an natural synergy of having an anchor destination on one side anchor destination on one side of the river and another of the river and another destination on the other side of destination on the other side of the river. In the past, when DC the river. In the past, when DC tried and failed to develop tried and failed to develop Poplar Point, one of the biggest Poplar Point, one of the biggest hurdles was relocating the U.S. hurdles was relocating the U.S. Park Police Heliport and other Park Police Heliport and other facilities currently located facilities currently located here. Albert says the city is here. Albert says the city is close to a deal with the Park close to a deal with the Park Service. They\u2019ve always been Service. They\u2019ve always been open to moving the helipad. The open to moving the helipad. The requirement of the land transfer requirement of the land transfer is that we find a suitable is that we find a suitable location and that we pay for location and that we pay for those replacement facilities, those replacement facilities, while any development is still while any development is still several years away, Albert is several years away, Albert is confident this time it will confident this time it will become a reality at Poplar become a reality at Poplar Point, Mark Segraves News 4.

His wife wouldn\u2019t open the off. His wife wouldn\u2019t open the door. We don\u2019t have any reason door. We don\u2019t have any reason to suspect the wife\u2019s here to suspect the wife\u2019s here illegally. But this has already illegally. But this has already been a busy day for Ice been a busy day for Ice enforcement and Removal enforcement and Removal operations team. Today we\u2019re operations team.

They\u2019re using what\u2019s called They\u2019re using what\u2019s called administrative warrants to make administrative warrants to make the arrest. None have current the arrest. None have current pending criminal charges. So why pending criminal charges. So why the early morning operations? the early morning operations? Most of our our targets, you Most of our our targets, you know, work early in the morning, know, work early in the morning, arresting someone when they\u2019re arresting someone when they\u2019re half asleep at 5:00 in the half asleep at 5:00 in the morning is less. There\u2019s morning is less. There\u2019s statistically there\u2019s less statistically there\u2019s less likelihood that they are going likelihood that they are going to fight back. We know the to fight back. We know the targets that we\u2019re going after, targets that we\u2019re going after, right? We don\u2019t do dragnets. We right? We don\u2019t do dragnets. We don\u2019t go door to door. That\u2019s don\u2019t go door to door. That\u2019s never something that ice has never something that ice has done. But the difference from done. But the difference from previous administrations, his previous administrations, his team can also make what\u2019s called team can also make what\u2019s called collateral arrests. Undocumented collateral arrests. Undocumented immigrants they come across with immigrants they come across with no criminal charges. We\u2019re still no criminal charges. We\u2019re still targeting that worst of the targeting that worst of the worst person you know. Except worst person you know. Except now if we come across someone now if we come across someone who\u2019s standing next to him, who\u2019s standing next to him, who\u2019s also here illegally, we\u2019re who\u2019s also here illegally, we\u2019re going to take that person, too. going to take that person, too. That happened after agents That happened after agents waited for more than two hours waited for more than two hours near the home of a man from El near the home of a man from El Salvador. Ice says he\u2019s been Salvador. Ice says he\u2019s been convicted of DUI and negligent convicted of DUI and negligent manslaughter. The stakeout is manslaughter. The stakeout is something that could not have something that could not have been done last year, due to a been done last year, due to a 2011 policy that limited them, 2011 policy that limited them, targeting people near sensitive targeting people near sensitive locations such as schools or locations such as schools or churches. But that policy was churches. But that policy was rescinded in January by DHS. rescinded in January by DHS. This building behind us is a This building behind us is a Baptist church. You know, Baptist church. You know, despite us not doing anything at despite us not doing anything at the church like we wouldn\u2019t even the church like we wouldn\u2019t even be allowed to be parked in a be allowed to be parked in a parking lot, really anywhere parking lot, really anywhere within like a two block radius within like a two block radius of here. We wouldn\u2019t be allowed of here. We wouldn\u2019t be allowed to work. After pulling him over, to work. After pulling him over, they also detained his brother. they also detained his brother. A collateral arrest. We also A collateral arrest. We also know that his brother was prior. know that his brother was prior. Prior deport. So he\u2019s been Prior deport. So he\u2019s been removed from the United States removed from the United States previously. Look, my family, my previously. Look, my family, my kids understand? You got to go. kids understand? You got to go. This is a total change and an This is a total change and an escalation in how immigrants are escalation in how immigrants are being treated. Attorney Michael being treated. Attorney Michael Lukens is with Amica Center for Lukens is with Amica Center for Immigrant Rights. It works to Immigrant Rights. It works to help detainees know their help detainees know their rights. I think what really rights. I think what really concerns me is you don\u2019t look at concerns me is you don\u2019t look at someone who was born in the someone who was born in the United States, who had a United States, who had a criminal background and say, criminal background and say, well, they are a criminal well, they are a criminal forever, right? You don\u2019t label forever, right? You don\u2019t label them a criminal and make them a them a criminal and make them a second class citizen. Why is it second class citizen. Why is it okay to do that for an okay to do that for an immigrant? Tensions are immigrant? Tensions are definitely much, much higher on definitely much, much higher on the Frimpong with the immigrant the Frimpong with the immigrant advocacy group Casa says there\u2019s advocacy group Casa says there\u2019s a lot of fear right now, a lot of fear right now, especially for families who especially for families who might lose a parent or might lose a parent or breadwinner to deportation. I breadwinner to deportation. I see, you know, moms, right, who see, you know, moms, right, who are trying to console their are trying to console their kids, right? And, you know, kids, right? And, you know, trying to tell them that trying to tell them that everything will be okay when everything will be okay when truly they don\u2019t know whether truly they don\u2019t know whether everything will be okay. Why are everything will be okay. Why are people willing to risk mass people willing to risk mass deportation risk being put in deportation risk being put in detention centers, risk having detention centers, risk having their families separated? Why? their families separated? Why? Because for a lot of people, Because for a lot of people, this is the better life. I think this is the better life. I think the real danger here is that the real danger here is that immigration advocacy groups are immigration advocacy groups are telling people, don\u2019t cooperate, telling people, don\u2019t cooperate, don\u2019t come to the door, don\u2019t don\u2019t come to the door, don\u2019t don\u2019t stop your vehicle. You don\u2019t stop your vehicle. You know, all of these things that know, all of these things that could then lead to criminal could then lead to criminal prosecutions. But people do have prosecutions. But people do have the right to remain silent. They the right to remain silent. They do have the right not to open do have the right not to open their door if there isn\u2019t a their door if there isn\u2019t a warrant signed by a judge. warrant signed by a judge. Correct? Correct. And now the Correct? Correct. And now the difference is we are we are much difference is we are we are much it is a much easier process for it is a much easier process for us to obtain that warrant signed us to obtain that warrant signed by a judge. Ellis says he hears by a judge. Ellis says he hears the concerns about Ice, but says the concerns about Ice, but says his agents are just following his agents are just following the law. You know, during one of the law. You know, during one of the arrests, we watched a woman the arrests, we watched a woman in a car drive by cursing at his in a car drive by cursing at his team. What goes through your team. What goes through your mind when that happens? You mind when that happens? You know, it\u2019s really a lack of know, it\u2019s really a lack of education. The average person, education. The average person, no matter where you fall on the no matter where you fall on the political spectrum, if they political spectrum, if they would stop and say, hey, like, would stop and say, hey, like, who is this person?

Well, the first things guys? Well, the first things first, we had to switch to first, we had to switch to essentially turning all visits, essentially turning all visits, electronic and telehealth visits electronic and telehealth visits that weren\u2019t in the hospital, that weren\u2019t in the hospital, which is thousands of visits which is thousands of visits overnight. All of a sudden we overnight. All of a sudden we did it. Somehow we did it. But did it. Somehow we did it. But then on top of that, also then on top of that, also worrying because at the time in worrying because at the time in March, we hadn\u2019t had our surge March, we hadn\u2019t had our surge in the DMV, but we were in the DMV, but we were preparing for it. But we didn\u2019t preparing for it. But we didn\u2019t have masks. We didn\u2019t have have masks. We didn\u2019t have tests. We didn\u2019t even know what tests. We didn\u2019t even know what to test for Shawn. So it was to test for Shawn. So it was just trying to get information, just trying to get information, which sounds a little crazy, was which sounds a little crazy, was the hardest thing to do at the the hardest thing to do at the time. I\u2019m just curious, as you time. I\u2019m just curious, as you look back at what you went look back at what you went through once you finally, I through once you finally, I guess, we started getting masks guess, we started getting masks and the telehealth was was part and the telehealth was was part of standard operating procedure. of standard operating procedure. What do you do now that\u2019s What do you do now that\u2019s different as a result of, of different as a result of, of that? We were just talking about that? We were just talking about this. I don\u2019t wear high heels this. I don\u2019t wear high heels anymore, I can tell you that. anymore, I can tell you that. And at work I now it\u2019s so funny. And at work I now it\u2019s so funny. I don\u2019t even know why I didn\u2019t I don\u2019t even know why I didn\u2019t wear a mask before. I\u2019ve noticed wear a mask before. I\u2019ve noticed that in the last five years I\u2019ve that in the last five years I\u2019ve had lower personal infections, had lower personal infections, and it\u2019s probably because I and it\u2019s probably because I started masking thinking about started masking thinking about others, thinking about the others, thinking about the waiting room and how it was waiting room and how it was situated. So we\u2019ve kind of situated. So we\u2019ve kind of redone the way we think about redone the way we think about just just respiratory diseases just just respiratory diseases and viruses, but keeping people and viruses, but keeping people safe inside of our clinics and safe inside of our clinics and hospitals. And I know that\u2019s one hospitals. And I know that\u2019s one of the most important things I of the most important things I want to ask you. I know in a want to ask you. I know in a recent article you discussed how recent article you discussed how the pandemic fractured the the pandemic fractured the American society, and our nation American society, and our nation still hasn\u2019t healed. Can you still hasn\u2019t healed. Can you explain what you mean? Yeah, it explain what you mean? Yeah, it feels very much like there\u2019s feels very much like there\u2019s almost two Americas. There\u2019s the almost two Americas. There\u2019s the America that I think some of us America that I think some of us who were whether we were front who were whether we were front lines, we were worried about lines, we were worried about loved ones or we experienced loved ones or we experienced loss of our own, like family loss of our own, like family members, deaths, illness that members, deaths, illness that that kind of stays with us five that kind of stays with us five years later, ten years later. years later, ten years later. And then there\u2019s another And then there\u2019s another America. They might have America. They might have experienced the same loss and experienced the same loss and death, but they were starting to death, but they were starting to grow kind of angry and angry grow kind of angry and angry about the vaccines, angry about about the vaccines, angry about mandates, angry about stay at mandates, angry about stay at home orders, angry about being home orders, angry about being at school. And it feels like in at school. And it feels like in that moment, we lost a chance to that moment, we lost a chance to kind of become one again. And kind of become one again. And I\u2019m hopeful that we can get back I\u2019m hopeful that we can get back there. Any ideas on your there. Any ideas on your thoughts on how we do that? I thoughts on how we do that? I think everything is local. I think everything is local.

You just talk to the away. You just talk to the person. So I\u2019m hopeful we can do person. So I\u2019m hopeful we can do that more. You and me both. that more. You and me both. Yeah. Let me ask you about Yeah. Let me ask you about something else we\u2019ve been something else we\u2019ve been talking about recently. Recent talking about recently. Recent the measles, the measles the measles, the measles outbreak that are happening in outbreak that are happening in different parts of our nation. different parts of our nation. What\u2019s to keep that or how is What\u2019s to keep that or how is that different? Because I know that different? Because I know just a few years ago, there had just a few years ago, there had not been measles cases or an not been measles cases or an outbreak like this in the U.S. outbreak like this in the U.S. For years. And you know what\u2019s For years. And you know what\u2019s different? What\u2019s to keep this different? What\u2019s to keep this from becoming like the Covid 19 from becoming like the Covid 19 pandemic? Well, one vaccines. So pandemic? Well, one vaccines. So we still have a very good we still have a very good blanket of immunity, especially blanket of immunity, especially in the DMV. Our vaccine rates in the DMV. Our vaccine rates for measles are in the 90s, and for measles are in the 90s, and that\u2019s enough to kind of keep that\u2019s enough to kind of keep like an insulated wall. So we like an insulated wall. So we did have a case in Dulles did have a case in Dulles airport. We\u2019ve got some cases in airport. We\u2019ve got some cases in the DMV, but I have confidence the DMV, but I have confidence that because of our vaccine that because of our vaccine rates here, that we\u2019re largely rates here, that we\u2019re largely going to be protected. That going to be protected. That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not going to doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not going to see some cases. So I\u2019m not see some cases. So I\u2019m not worried about this kind of worried about this kind of spreading the way. We saw Covid spreading the way. We saw Covid spread. We didn\u2019t have the spread. We didn\u2019t have the vaccine then, but I think we\u2019ve vaccine then, but I think we\u2019ve got a significant amount of got a significant amount of misinformation and confusion. misinformation and confusion. I\u2019ve had patients ask me about I\u2019ve had patients ask me about vitamin A, cod liver oil, vitamin A, cod liver oil, nutrition. All of those things nutrition. All of those things can be helpful, but it all can be helpful, but it all starts with a vaccine. starts with a vaccine. Absolutely. Let me go back to Absolutely. Let me go back to just Covid for a minute. How do just Covid for a minute. How do we make sure that we don\u2019t have we make sure that we don\u2019t have another pandemic that\u2019s like another pandemic that\u2019s like Covid, which there was no Covid, which there was no vaccine for at the time? We vaccine for at the time? We prepare, prepare, prepare. I prepare, prepare, prepare. I think one of the things that we think one of the things that we saw was that when the world saw was that when the world cooperates, we can get a vaccine cooperates, we can get a vaccine done in a safe and effective. We done in a safe and effective. We weren\u2019t rushing the vaccine, but weren\u2019t rushing the vaccine, but we were all able to cooperate we were all able to cooperate and get it in months. And that and get it in months. And that was incredible. We can do that was incredible. We can do that with public health measures. But with public health measures. But it\u2019s also it\u2019s hard when we\u2019re it\u2019s also it\u2019s hard when we\u2019re withdrawing from the World withdrawing from the World Health Organization or we\u2019re Health Organization or we\u2019re taking away you just mentioned taking away you just mentioned $1 billion in cuts. Some of $1 billion in cuts. Some of that\u2019s going to come to health that\u2019s going to come to health access services. So we need to access services. So we need to prepare by investing in the very prepare by investing in the very safety net that protected us, safety net that protected us, and then also acknowledge what and then also acknowledge what didn\u2019t protect us. You bet that didn\u2019t protect us.

The city frustrating and unfair. The city just restarted a pilot program just restarted a pilot program aimed at helping the I-Team aimed at helping the I-Team tracked the city\u2019s first efforts tracked the city\u2019s first efforts in that program, and found out in that program, and found out it cost DC Taxpayers more than it cost DC Taxpayers more than 600. Excuse me, $600 per ride. 600. Excuse me, $600 per ride. Per taxi ride. That\u2019s provided. Per taxi ride. That\u2019s provided.

Ted Oberg and the I-Team went Ted Oberg and the I-Team went looking for answers. It says looking for answers. It says assigning driver on the assigning driver on the afternoon we caught up with afternoon we caught up with Kelly Mack. She just needed a Kelly Mack. She just needed a ride to the grocery store.

Max used a wheelchair since she was ten, wheelchair since she was ten, moved to DC after college, she moved to DC after college, she tells us, because our city was tells us, because our city was trying to be more accessible. trying to be more accessible. Are they keeping the promise? So Are they keeping the promise? So here and there? It\u2019s not exactly here and there? It\u2019s not exactly the city\u2019s motto. It\u2019s hard. DC the city\u2019s motto. It\u2019s hard. DC Has a few options for passengers Has a few options for passengers with wheelchairs. Metro is with wheelchairs. Metro is accessible. Metro access works, accessible. Metro access works, too, but requires setting up too, but requires setting up rides days in advance and being rides days in advance and being willing to wait. The transport willing to wait. The transport DC Program offers subsidized DC Program offers subsidized taxi rides, but only within the taxi rides, but only within the district. The district doesn\u2019t district. The district doesn\u2019t require rideshare companies like require rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft to have wheelchair Uber and Lyft to have wheelchair accessible vehicles, and they accessible vehicles, and they account for 95% of all the for account for 95% of all the for hire rides here, which leaves hire rides here, which leaves taxis. They make up just 5% of taxis. They make up just 5% of all the for hire trips in DC Did all the for hire trips in DC Did they have someone? They didn\u2019t they have someone? They didn\u2019t have anyone yet. Taxis are have anyone yet. Taxis are district regulated and provided district regulated and provided 23,000 trips for people who use 23,000 trips for people who use wheelchairs last year. Riders wheelchairs last year. Riders like Kelly tell us wheelchair like Kelly tell us wheelchair accessible taxis are not exactly accessible taxis are not exactly plentiful when you need one. I plentiful when you need one. I call it the Yeti because it\u2019s call it the Yeti because it\u2019s rumored to exist, but you know, rumored to exist, but you know, I rarely ever see it. Which is I rarely ever see it. Which is why the district, with every why the district, with every good intention, has tried to good intention, has tried to increase service. DC Has a law increase service. DC Has a law mandating 20% of large cab mandating 20% of large cab fleets have to be wheelchair fleets have to be wheelchair accessible, but the I-Team accessible, but the I-Team couldn\u2019t find that it\u2019s ever couldn\u2019t find that it\u2019s ever been enforced. And the head of been enforced. And the head of the department with oversight the department with oversight told us we can\u2019t punish them told us we can\u2019t punish them into compliance. There really, into compliance. There really, really needs to be progress. really needs to be progress. Naomi Hesse was hopeful last Naomi Hesse was hopeful last year when DC Set aside 500,000 year when DC Set aside 500,000 more of your dollars to more of your dollars to incentivize cab drivers to incentivize cab drivers to operate wheelchair accessible operate wheelchair accessible vehicles, paying those drivers vehicles, paying those drivers more per hour or to work late more per hour or to work late hours. The city even set up a hours. The city even set up a hotline for people to get hotline for people to get connected. I tried that pilot connected. I tried that pilot line multiple times and they line multiple times and they just couldn\u2019t find one for me. just couldn\u2019t find one for me. Where is the money going? The Where is the money going? The district spent $255,000 in that district spent $255,000 in that pilot program, which generated pilot program, which generated 435 wheelchair taxi trips over 435 wheelchair taxi trips over six months. That\u2019s $586.21 per six months. That\u2019s $586.21 per ride. Not exactly a return on ride. Not exactly a return on investment to brag about. investment to brag about. Jonathan Rogers, the director of Jonathan Rogers, the director of DC\u2019s Department of for hire DC\u2019s Department of for hire vehicles, which spearheaded the vehicles, which spearheaded the pilot, wouldn\u2019t talk to us on pilot, wouldn\u2019t talk to us on camera, but he told the I-Team camera, but he told the I-Team Council, encouraged us to Council, encouraged us to experiment and figure out what experiment and figure out what would change behavior. So that\u2019s would change behavior. So that\u2019s what we did. He said he hoped it what we did. He said he hoped it would build momentum and that would build momentum and that the six new drivers added to the the six new drivers added to the program would stick with it. program would stick with it. Anyone without a wheelchair can Anyone without a wheelchair can get an Uber, Lyft or taxi get an Uber, Lyft or taxi whenever they want. It\u2019s just whenever they want. It\u2019s just not fair. Last fall, Naomi Hesse not fair. Last fall, Naomi Hesse had all her travel planned out had all her travel planned out so she could attend the Sabrina so she could attend the Sabrina Carpenter concert in Baltimore, Carpenter concert in Baltimore, but a delayed Amtrak train got but a delayed Amtrak train got her to Union Station at one in her to Union Station at one in the morning, leaving her with the morning, leaving her with few options. I was forced to few options. I was forced to walk home alone in the middle of walk home alone in the middle of the night. She says. It isn\u2019t the night. She says. It isn\u2019t like this everywhere in New York like this everywhere in New York City, there are more than 12,000 City, there are more than 12,000 wheelchair accessible taxis and wheelchair accessible taxis and rideshare vehicles. That city rideshare vehicles. That city says 46% of their taxi fleet is says 46% of their taxi fleet is wheelchair accessible. And by wheelchair accessible. And by law, anyone who now wants to law, anyone who now wants to start driving for a rideshare start driving for a rideshare company there must use an company there must use an accessible vehicle. Here in D.C, accessible vehicle. Here in D.C, Uber has a few, but didn\u2019t Uber has a few, but didn\u2019t respond to any of our questions respond to any of our questions about wheelchair vehicles. Lyft about wheelchair vehicles. Lyft has none in D.C, but does offer has none in D.C, but does offer them in nine other cities. They them in nine other cities. They told the I-Team it will continue told the I-Team it will continue to push for solutions that make to push for solutions that make rideshare as accessible as rideshare as accessible as possible for everyone. This one possible for everyone. This one needs a transmission. This one needs a transmission. This one needs a transmission. As for needs a transmission. As for taxis, none of the larger taxis, none of the larger companies in town would talk to companies in town would talk to us on camera, but did admit it us on camera, but did admit it is a challenge saying wheelchair is a challenge saying wheelchair accessible taxis are both accessible taxis are both expensive to buy and costly to expensive to buy and costly to maintain due mostly to their maintain due mostly to their weight and modifications, which weight and modifications, which could explain why we found so could explain why we found so many in their lots. Do you have many in their lots. Do you have an estimated time for riders an estimated time for riders like Kelly Mack, who just wants like Kelly Mack, who just wants to get to the store? It all to get to the store? It all feels pretty isolating. I had 72 feels pretty isolating. I had 72 attempted trips. So frustrating. attempted trips. So frustrating. She started tracking every taxi She started tracking every taxi call she made for the last three call she made for the last three years. 71% failure rate, which years. 71% failure rate, which is exactly what happened on the is exactly what happened on the day we spent with her. Well, we day we spent with her. Well, we a few more minutes and then a few more minutes and then probably gear up, put on the probably gear up, put on the coat, head out. She is upbeat, coat, head out. She is upbeat, but it was so frustrating to but it was so frustrating to watch, knowing almost three watch, knowing almost three quarters of the time this quarters of the time this doesn\u2019t work for her. DC\u2019s doesn\u2019t work for her. DC\u2019s Department of For-hire vehicles Department of For-hire vehicles told us it is offering more told us it is offering more incentives in a new version of incentives in a new version of the pilot program, launched just the pilot program, launched just a short time ago, and they\u2019ll be a short time ago, and they\u2019ll be sending letters to all taxi sending letters to all taxi companies asking for their long companies asking for their long term plans to address this term plans to address this shortage.
