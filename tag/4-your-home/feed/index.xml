<p>A local realtor is creating a roar on social media with a whisper.</p>



<p>Lisa DuBois, a RE/MAX realtor in business for 20 years, uses her social media platforms to promote her listings. Recently, she found a creative and unique way to get more traction.</p>



<p>A few months ago, she decided that due to the heaviness of the world around us, her videos could use something fun, so she partnered with brand strategist Eric Cruz.</p>



<p>Cruz wanted to personalize DuBois&#8217; social media videos. First, he asked her how seriously she took herself.</p>



<p>&#8220;Not at all,” DuBois replied.</p>



<p>Her answer led Cruz to suggest playing hide-and-seek in her listings. Now, they&#8217;ve become a viral sensation. One video already has over 13 million views.</p>



<p>DuBois showcases her properties with a now-signature style, playing hide-and-seek while using autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR), as she whispers.</p>



<p>“I had to learn (ASMR),&#8221; she said. &#8220;That first meeting with Eric, he said, ‘OK, great. We’re gonna have some fun. Let’s do some ASMR.’ And I was like, ‘Sure, what is it?’ And he wanted me to tap my fingernails on the counter, but my fingernails are too short. So, he said, &#8216;OK. We&#8217;re gonna whisper.”</p>



<p>News4 couldn&#8217;t let DuBois leave without making our own hide-and-seek video at the station. </p>







<p>Partnering with Cruz helps DuBois&#8217; videos pop, leading to great numbers.</p>



<p>“Usually, the hide-and-seek videos are like 10-20 minutes,&#8221; Cruz said. &#8220;It probably takes me that same amount of time to edit them. Sometimes, I&#8217;ll be like, Oh my God! This needs to come out, like, right now, and I&#8217;ll go out in my car for a second and edit real quick.”</p>



<p>DuBois said those views translate to clicks on her listings in D.C. and Virginia.</p>



<p>“A lot of follow-up calls from other agents going, &#8216;How many more leads? How many more sales?'&#8221; she said. &#8220;And none, yet. I&#8217;ve got a very, very solid real estate business. I did this for fun. This was to make myself laugh.”</p>

<p>A local realtor is creating a roar on social media with a whisper.</p>



<p>Lisa DuBois, a RE/MAX realtor in business for 20 years, uses her social media platforms to promote her listings. Recently, she found a creative and unique way to get more traction.</p>



<p>A few months ago, she decided that due to the heaviness of the world around us, her videos could use something fun, so she partnered with brand strategist Eric Cruz.</p>



<p>Cruz wanted to personalize DuBois&#8217; social media videos. First, he asked her how seriously she took herself.</p>



<p>&#8220;Not at all,” DuBois replied.</p>



<p>Her answer led Cruz to suggest playing hide-and-seek in her listings. Now, they&#8217;ve become a viral sensation. One video already has over 13 million views.</p>



<p>DuBois showcases her properties with a now-signature style, playing hide-and-seek while using autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR), as she whispers.</p>



<p>“I had to learn (ASMR),&#8221; she said. &#8220;That first meeting with Eric, he said, ‘OK, great. We’re gonna have some fun. Let’s do some ASMR.’ And I was like, ‘Sure, what is it?’ And he wanted me to tap my fingernails on the counter, but my fingernails are too short. So, he said, &#8216;OK. We&#8217;re gonna whisper.”</p>



<p>News4 couldn&#8217;t let DuBois leave without making our own hide-and-seek video at the station. </p>







<p>Partnering with Cruz helps DuBois&#8217; videos pop, leading to great numbers.</p>



<p>“Usually, the hide-and-seek videos are like 10-20 minutes,&#8221; Cruz said. &#8220;It probably takes me that same amount of time to edit them. Sometimes, I&#8217;ll be like, Oh my God! This needs to come out, like, right now, and I&#8217;ll go out in my car for a second and edit real quick.”</p>



<p>DuBois said those views translate to clicks on her listings in D.C. and Virginia.</p>



<p>“A lot of follow-up calls from other agents going, &#8216;How many more leads? How many more sales?'&#8221; she said. &#8220;And none, yet. I&#8217;ve got a very, very solid real estate business. I did this for fun. This was to make myself laugh.”</p>
