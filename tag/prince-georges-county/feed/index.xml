<p>A recording studio in Brentwood, Maryland, is a little quieter than it used to be.</p>



<p>Lowcation Studios has lost one of its talented audio engineers, Dinari McAlmont, who was found dead shortly after arriving in the Bahamas for vacation.</p>



<p>“I just broke down,” said Oliver Franklin, the owner of Lowcation Studios. “He was, he was really young, and it&#8217;s just, it&#8217;s just devastating.&#8221;</p>



<p>Franklin said McAlmont worked there for the last year producing music.</p>



<p>&#8220;In that year, you know, he was somebody that, you know, I talked to every day,” Franklin said. “You know, he was always obviously in the studio, and it was just crushing.&#8221;</p>



<p>McAlmont and his parents live in Bowie, Maryland. They flew to the Bahamas for vacation Friday.</p>



<p>Less than a day into the trip, his aunt, Marcelle Bacchus, told News4 the 23-year-old was found dead on the beach near his resort, Atlantis Bahamas.</p>



<p>News4 spoke with her by phone.</p>



<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have answers,” Bacchus said. “We don&#8217;t really know, but it&#8217;s very frustrating. Seems as though everything is being pushed under the rug.&#8221;</p>



<p>Bahamian police say an autopsy showed McAlmont drowned, and they do not suspect foul play.</p>



<p>But his family has questions.</p>



<p>The police told them there was some type of issue at a restaurant before McAlmont&#8217;s body was found.</p>



<p>&#8220;They said he spat on someone and ran through a door,&#8221; Bacchus said.</p>



<p>She says his mother told her when she went to see his body, authorities would only show her a photo. She said it looked like McAlmont had been beaten.</p>



<p>They also question why no surveillance video has been released.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just here in the dark,” Bacchus said. “We really need some help, some eyewitness, somebody to come forward and help us to just solve this puzzle.&#8221;</p>



<p>News4 reached out to the resort to help them get some answers. They sent a statement saying, “We are deeply saddened by the passing of one of our guests. Our condolences are with the guest&#8217;s family and loved ones during this difficult time. The police authorities are carrying out an investigation of this tragic incident. We await the police’s findings and will not comment on speculation.”</p>



<p>Bacchus told News4 the family is working to get an international attorney that can help them going forward.</p>



<p>News4 spoke with McAlmont&#8217;s father by phone Wednesday. He is still in the Bahamas. He declined to be interviewed.</p>

<p>For the past two decades, residents of Indian Head, Maryland, had to travel almost 10 miles to pick up their essential groceries, but that changed in the fall when a couple opened a new food market to meet that need in a food desert.</p>



<p>Mark and Marilyn Steele hadn’t planned to own a food market, but they knew the need was severe.</p>



<p>“A grocery store is a cornerstone of a community, and if you want to see a healthy community, you’ve got to have a good store,” Marilyn Steele said.</p>



<p>Indian Head was without a grocery store for almost 25 years.</p>



<p>“I’m like, ‘Oh, my God! That shouldn’t be,’” Marilyn Steel said.</p>



<p>For more than a decade, the town was a federally deemed food desert.</p>



<p>“A lot of folks, they don’t have access to transportation, that just means elderly populations or different income levels, that kind of all feed into that equation,” Indian Head Mayor Brandon Paulin said.</p>



<p>He said work to bring a grocery store to the area started well before he became mayor.</p>



<p>“In 1999, the Super Fresh left the town of Indian Head, and they’re have been many folks, town councils over the years that have tried to address the issue,” Paulin said.</p>



<p>Then the Steeles got involved. They already owned a coffee shop, but the new business venture could serve as an oasis, which is why the store was named Oasis Fresh Foods Market.</p>



<p>The Steeles hope to achieve one goal for their customers.</p>



<p>“I wanted to give everyone a fighting chance at feeding their family well, and that’s what this store represents,” Marilyn Steele said. “You can go from your fresh produce to meats. You can go from canned vegetables to breads. You can go from grab-and-go to prepared foods. It has everything you need to sustain a family well.”</p>

<p>After years of talks and plans, the Blue Line Corridor project in Prince George&#8217;s County officially started construction on Wednesday.</p>



<p>Elected county and state leaders broke ground on the developing Largo Civic Plaza, which is part of the first phase of the $400 million Blue Line Corridor project. The Civic Plaza in Largo is set to open in December.</p>



<p>The project was the vision of U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks when she was Prince George&#8217;s county executive. Leaders hope the corridor will lead to as much as $2 billion in investments.</p>



<p>“Today is a moment of pride,&#8221; Maryland State Sen. Nick Charles said at the ceremony. &#8220;It’s a moment of progress and a moment of promise for Prince George&#8217;s County.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alsobrooks spoke at the groundbreaking ceremony and recalled her efforts to convince former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan to support the project. She said the former governor initially didn&#8217;t want to pour money into the area because he didn&#8217;t like Daniel Snyder, who owned the Washington Commanders at that time.</p>



<p>“We had a really aggressive conversation where I said to him, ‘Why would we leave the people who live around the FedEx field in the lurch because of whatever we feel about the owner? We have an obligation to invest there,&#8217;” Alsobrooks said during the ceremony.</p>



<p>Hogan appeared with Alsobrooks at a Blue Line corridor funding announcement in April 2022. At the time, both leaders said the investments would happen with or without the team being in Landover.</p>



<p>Although the funding is going through the Maryland Stadium Authority — a first for Prince George&#8217;s County — it&#8217;s not being used to build a new home for the Commanders.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Hogan told News4 that he didn&#8217;t want any deals that would benefit Snyder.</p>



<p>&#8220;He was proud to work with the then-county executive to deliver on the legislation making these transformational investments possible,&#8221; the spokesperson said in a statement.</p>



<p>The project corridor stretches from Largo Town Center to Morgan Boulevard to Addison Road-Seat Pleasant to Capitol Heights. County leaders said it serves communities that have been left behind</p>



<p>“We&#8217;ve been pounding the pavement to get quality development in our area to attract quality business,” said Rande Atcherson from the Largo Town Center Association.</p>



<p>The plaza will have a lawn and stage area for community events and festivals, a playground for children, an artwalk with seating and a dog park. The corridor will eventually include a sports and entertainment zone, a library, amphitheater and youth sports fieldhouse at the conclusion of the project’s five phases.</p>

<p>A staple in Prince George&#8217;s County is preparing to close its doors after 37 years of serving the community.</p>



<p>Linen World was a one-stop shop for customers looking to spruce up their homes, but the owners of a store —one that transformed houses into homes — have decided to close.</p>



<p>&#8220;Being a part of the community, the customers — we service more of our older customers, and they really appreciate having that one-on-one interaction,” initial owner Dee Gaister said.</p>



<p>Sisters bonding over a great deal and families stopping by to find the right sheets — &#8220;finding those special little things that they don’t find in other stores&#8221; — were just a few memorable customer stories for Gaister, the store&#8217;s initial owner.</p>



<p>Patrecia Williams spent years shopping at Linen World, trying to find those special trinkets, before joining the team herself.</p>



<p>&#8220;But 24 years, I actually came to the store. A lot of times, in the store, I would come to the store; I would help the participants; I would help the people that are here, as if I worked here,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Because it’s all about relationships.&#8221;</p>



<p>Linen World has been a family-run business in Oxon Hill for nearly four decades.</p>



<p>The company says over the years, they’ve taken pride in going the extra mile, making customers feel appreciated while supplying the essentials: comforters, towel and shower curtains, to name a few.</p>



<p>&#8220;We provide customer service that a lot of places don’t, picking out linens and stuff for your home requires matching colors and styles, and I think we’ve really excelled at that,&#8221; Jason Gaister said. He took over the business three years ago.</p>



<p>He says a few factors during the past year led to the difficult decision to close.</p>



<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, there’s just a lot of competition coming from China and coming from the big box retailers, and we just — we can’t keep up,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Rather than up-charging customers and trying to keep up with a changing business model, Linen World decided this month that everything must go.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to be missed by the community, and we’re going to miss the community,&#8221; Jason Gaister said. &#8220;Our customers are great; our employees are great; we’ve loved working with everyone while we had the opportunity, but it’s certainly bittersweet.&#8221;</p>



<p>The owners say they plan to close their doors when all their inventory is gone. They plan to raise their final sale discounts each week until all items are off the shelves.</p>

<p>There’s an urgent call to action coming from the steps of Congress.</p>



<p>“We have to keep fighting, whether it’s education, whether it’s cuts to government employees,” said Rep. Glenn Ivey, who represents Maryland&#8217;s Fourth District.</p>



<p>Days after the Department of Education announced it won’t pay out hundreds of millions of dollars in COVID-19 relief funds to school districts across the country, Ivey spoke with News4 and said Maryland leaders are keeping all options on the table to secure those federal funds.</p>



<p>“One of the things we’re trying to do is push directly back with the secretary of education,” he said. “The Maryland delegation is working on an effort to do a letter to raise this and tell them to reconsider.”</p>

<p>Secretary of Education Linda McMahon sent out a letter Friday saying the federal government will not pay school districts the COVID relief funds they had been promised.</p>



<p>Maryland education leaders say that adds up to a budget shortfall of about $418 million.</p>



<p>“These funds have been spent or committed with every expectation of reimbursement,” said Carey Wright, the Maryland state superintendent of schools.</p>



<p>“It’s going to be a loss of teachers, sometimes it’s going to be a loss of materials or specialized teachers as well that could be helpful,” Ivey said.</p>



<p>He called the potential cuts catastrophic for local school districts. For example, Prince George&#8217;s County Public Schools officials say they could be short tens of millions of dollars in the next fiscal year.</p>



<p>“I think there will be lawsuits that are filed, so we’ll see how it plays out, but the bottom line is this could be devastating to the school system,” Ivey said. “Prince George’s County, but across the state and could also be damaging to teachers and students at a time when they need the money the most.”</p>



<p>Ivey didn’t give a specific timeline on their response to the Department of Education or potential legal action, but he said the issue needs to be addressed as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Prince George&#8217;s County leaders celebrated the opening of a new human services building Tuesday as part of a wider redevelopment project in Capitol Heights.</p>



<p>The building, located in Hampton Park, consolidates health and wellness services that were previously spread throughout the county, putting agencies like social services, family services and senior activities under one roof.</p>



<p>“So many of our residents have to travel to get the support and services that they need, so the fact that it’s right here inside the beltway in Capitol Heights is so, so special to us,” acting Prince George’s County Executive Tara Jackson said.</p>



<p>County and state leaders cut the ribbon for the new building Tuesday morning alongside their partner, Velocity Companies.</p>



<p>The building includes modernized offices, conference rooms, and a gym with weights and treadmills for seniors.</p>



<p>During the grand opening, leaders spoke about the many challenges and work throughout multiple administrations to open the building, which was under development for more than 10 years.</p>



<p>“This building was a long time in coming, and I am so excited because we are finally here,” Jackson said.</p>



<p>The development is part of a public-private partnership with county government, state government and Velocity Companies. The building was designed to break barriers to wellness and care.</p>



<p>The building is part of a larger $250 million Hampton Park redevelopment project, which is in the first phase. The cost of the building was $71.6 million.</p>



<p>Brandon Bellamy, the CEO of Velocity Companies, said the project will include 200 market-rate residential units, a 120-room hotel and 55,000 square feet of green space, specifically designed for “arts, entertainment and community experience.”</p>



<p>Councilwoman Wala Blegay said the development will be a live-work-and-play destination in Prince George&#8217;s County.</p>



<p>“Put the word out,” Blegay said at the ceremony. “People always talking about, ‘Where is the quality retail? Where is the quality in Prince George&#8217;s county?’ This is it.”</p>

<p>A new bill introduced in Prince George&#8217;s County looks to assist federal workers who were furloughed or laid off.</p>



<p>It comes after the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, slashed thousands of federal jobs.</p>



<p>“If our federal workers are unable to pay their mortgages and fall back, I mean, it’s going to have a huge impact,” said Councilwoman Wala Blegay, one of the sponsors of the bill.</p>



<p>The Federal Worker Emergency Assistance Act would first offer a $1,000 check per person along with creating housing and utility relief in the form of temporary property tax deferments and waived late fees for up to six months.</p>



<p>“We want them to know that they are heard,” Blegay said. “They have come to me complaining about not feeling the support, and I’m just letting them know we are here.”</p>



<p>The legislation comes at a time when Prince George&#8217;s County is dealing with a projected $170 million shortfall. Blegay says she understands the budget constraints and is willing to work to find common ground.</p>



<p>“We’ve narrowed the amount that each person will get,” Blegay said. “We do understand that we’re dealing with a budget deficit right now, however, we need to do something,”</p>



<p>At least 75,000 county residents work for the federal government. The legislation would look to expand food bank access and grocery voucher programs, offer incentives for businesses that hire laid-off workers and offer free job training.</p>



<p>“We’re going to need to bridge just a little bit of assistance to keep people going,” said Krystal Oriadha, co-chair of Prince George’s County Council and co-sponsor of the bill.</p>



<p>Oriadha said these measures are just the first step in creating more opportunities for laid off workers.</p>



<p>“The real reality is how do make sure that people go back to work and they also stay here in Prince George’s County,” Oriadha said.</p>

<p>School districts across the DMV are opening up their doors for federal workers in need of a career change.</p>



<p>Amid so much uncertainty within the federal workforce, federal workers like Monique Mason are searching for new opportunities.</p>



<p>“Divine Alignment,” she said. “Everything happens for a reason.”</p>



<p>Mason is currently on administrative leave from her job at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.</p>



<p>“So I&#8217;m just the type of person that, if it&#8217;s meant to be, it&#8217;s meant to be, if it&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s not,” she said.</p>



<p>Mason is among the many probationary employees terminated by the Trump administration recently.</p>



<p>Saturday, she attended a recruitment fair put on by Prince George&#8217;s County Public Schools at Fairmont Heights High School.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re just constantly looking to grow the pool, so the more the merrier,” said Senior Recruitment Advisor Tiffany Doster.</p>



<p>School districts host these job fairs every year — this year, many of them invited former federal workers searching for jobs. Earlier this month – Arlington County Public Schools held a similar event.</p>



<p>About 500 people signed up for the PGCPS fair. There were on the spot interviews and virtual interviews. Some candidates received an offer the same day.</p>



<p>“Depending on your background and your career, with all the different programs that we offer, there&#8217;s something for everyone,” Doster said. “And I know that someone&#8217;s experience could definitely be critical and useful to helping our students grow.”</p>



<p>Mason actually used to teach for PGCPS a few years ago and is ready to return to the classroom. She encourages other federal employees to consider making the switch.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s a lot open for you, and they allow you to get the training to even become certified,” she said. “So I just tell everybody, just keep the faith and know that it&#8217;s not the end of the road.”</p>



<p>PGCPS is currently hiring special education teachers, classroom teachers, long-term substitutes and bus drivers and is holding another fair in Upper Marlboro on April 26.</p>

<p>Maryland officials shared a heartbreaking update after a great-grandfather with Alzheimer’s disease left home for a walk in January and never returned.</p>



<p>Richard Wilson Jr. was found dead in water in Fort Washington on Thursday afternoon after going missing from his Waldorf home two months earlier, the Charles County Sheriff’s Office said. Wilson was 86.</p>



<p>“Our hearts go out to Mr. Wilson’s family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time,” Sheriff Troy Berry said in a statement.</p>



<p>Prince George’s County police told Charles County detectives at about 2 p.m. Thursday that they found Wilson’s body in water near Mariner Drive, which is along the Potomac River. He was last seen on Swan Creek Road, the sheriff’s office said. Swan Creek Road is about 2 miles south of Mariner Drive.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/great-grandfather-missing-imaryland/3850499/">Wilson’s family told News4 he went for an afternoon walk in cold weather on Jan. 25</a>. The family spoke with him by cellphone that day and tried to get him to describe where he was during the frantic search for him.</p>



<p>“We had him on the phone for four hours,” daughter LaWan Bowman told News4. “The police officers were there at the house. One officer had the opportunity to talk with him. And I asked, were there any homes or stores or anything near him, and he told me no. He said that he had slipped on some ice, the ice had cracked. So, he was wet, and I could hear him blowing in his hands, trying to keep his hands warm.”</p>



<p>Detectives used cellphone tracking tools, boats, dive teams, helicopters and K-9s to try to find Wilson, the sheriff’s office said. Earlier this week, searchers from multiple law enforcement agencies searched the Fort Washington Park area, about five miles from where Wilson’s body was found, the sheriff&#8217;s office said. </p>

<p>Wilson had vision problems, in addition to memory issues, his daughter said. </p>



<p>He may have been trying to walk from Waldorf to the Eastover Shopping Center in Oxon Hill, where his daughters took him once a month to play keno and the lottery. It was a small pleasure after a lifetime of hard work. He retired from Saint Elizabeths Hospital in D.C. after 42 years, his daughter said.</p>



<p>An autopsy will determine Wilson&#8217;s cause of death.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Maryland lawmakers considered a bill Thursday that would end cooperative agreements between local sheriff&#8217;s departments and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>



<p>The legislation is part of an effort by some lawmakers to counter President Donald Trump&#8217;s deportation efforts. The bill&#8217;s supporters said they want to protect those who live in Maryland no matter where they&#8217;re from.</p>



<p>The bill’s sponsor, Maryland Del. Nicole Williams, D-Prince George&#8217;s County, said the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts create fear.</p>



<p>“I have constituents in my district who are not sending children to school because they are afraid of what might happen if they confront an ICE officer,” Williams said.</p>



<p>House Bill 1222 would ban 287(g) programs, which allow ICE to collaborate with state and local law enforcement officers to perform specified immigration officer duties under the agency’s oversight.</p>



<p>In Maryland, the programs are partnerships between sheriff&#8217;s offices and ICE, which can lead to the agency arresting and deporting undocumented inmates. The bill, which is called the Maryland Values Act, states law enforcement may not enter into an immigration agreement.</p>



<p>Williams said the bill also lays the framework for how cooperation between local law enforcement and ICE should work.</p>



<p>“Local law enforcement officers and our local corrections officers will contact ICE 48 hours prior to the release of any individual that had been convicted of any of those heinous or serious crimes,” Williams said.</p>



<p>Critics of the bill said the ban could make communities less safe.</p>



<p>Three county sheriff&#8217;s offices in Maryland, including Frederick County, have 287(g) programs. Frederick County Sheriff Charles Jenkins said about 1,800 people have been removed through his program since 2008. He said losing it would make the county less safe.</p>



<p>“It will invite criminals, criminal gangs, increase criminal activity, which now basically stays out of Frederick County because of the program,” Jenkins said.</p>



<p>Jenkins joined several sheriffs from across the state in Annapolis to oppose the legislation ahead of its state Senate hearing. The bill has already passed the Maryland House of Delegates.</p>



<p>“I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anyone who would agree that making sure criminals do not get released back into the community is not a public safety issue,” Maryland ICE Director Matt Elliston said at the news conference.</p>



<p>In Maryland, the cooperative agreements allow deputies to ask questions and check the status of anyone detained in the local jail to see if there is a detainer. If there is, law enforcement notify ICE.</p>

<p>Williams fought back on claims that ending the agreements would make it harder for ICE enforcement. Williams referenced the February ICE arrest of a man, who was allegedly a high-level leader in the gang MS-13, in Hyattsville as an example.</p>



<p>“ICE is still able to effectively do their job without these agreements,” Williams said.</p>



<p>Harford and Cecil counties also have 287(g) programs. If the legislation passes, existing agreements must end by July 1.</p>

<p>A Baltimore man will spend decades in prison for the fatal shooting of a woman who was visiting Prince George&#8217;s County from El Salvador to attend her grandson&#8217;s funeral.</p>



<p>Lidia de Carrillo had no connection with the man who shot her, police said, and two years later, they are still trying to figure out why Troy Medley pulled the trigger.</p>



<p>Surveillance video captured the gunshots that killed de Carrillo as she sat innocently sitting in a car with her granddaughter in Capitol Heights.</p>



<p>In the video, a car is seen backing up. Prosecutors said that was Medley driving away after the shooting.</p>



<p>According to prosecutors, de Carrillo, 62, had just pulled into the driveway of a relative&#8217;s home when Medley got out his car and fired into her car, hitting her in the back.</p>



<p>De Carrillo had been in the U.S. for just one day, visiting to attend the funeral of a grandson killed in a car crash.</p>



<p>“Mr. Troy Medley decided on his own, doesn’t know these folks, he just wanted to shoot and kill that night,” Prince George’s County State’s Attorney Aisha Braveboy said.</p>



<p>Medley also fired shots into a nearby home near a convenience store, investigators said.</p>



<p>Surveillance video captured the gunfire as well as someone firing back from the store, prosecutors said. Someone is seen holding a gun.</p>



<p>Medley&#8217;s Lexus was seen on surveillance video at three shooting scenes. A unique exhaust sound can be heard in the videos.</p>



<p>Police in Baltimore arrested Medley on gun charges, impounded the Lexus and recovered two guns, one of which was a potential match for a homicide, investigators said.</p>



<p>A combination of the video, witness accounts and gun evidence led to Medley’s arrest.</p>



<p>Medley was found guilty of second-degree murder, assault and weapons charges. A judge sentenced him to the maximum 85 years in prison.</p>



<p>De Carrillo’s granddaughter, Fatima Carrillo, is satisfied with the sentence.</p>



<p>“We were asking for a maximum penalty, and I feel like 85 years are more than enough,” she said.</p>



<p>“Our family’s never going to be able to move on from that,” Carrillo said.</p>



<p>Medley awaits trial in Baltimore on assault charges, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>Jolene Ivey was expected to be a top candidate in the race to succeed Sen. Angela Alsobrooks for Prince George&#8217;s County executive. She suspended her campaign weeks before the primary and later announced she’s facing health challenges.</p>



<p>In a surprise vote Tuesday, Ivey was voted out as Prince George’s County Council chair and replaced by vice chair Ed Burroughs.</p>



<p>Before that vote, News4 spoke with Ivey about what happened during her campaign for county executive and what’s next for her and the county as it transitions to new leadership.</p>



<p>Ivey had just won reelection to the county council, transitioning from District 5 to an at-large seat, when she entered the county executive race last fall. She quickly received high-profile endorsements from members of Congress and ran TV ads – before the campaign abruptly stopped.</p>



<p>“When I started with the ads, I intended to win,” Ivey said.</p>



<p>“The moment that my doctor called and gave me the come to Jesus moment, I believe the decision was made right then,” she continued.</p>



<p>Ivey’s decision left voters who supported her in shock. Then, last week, she released a statement describing multiple health challenges that she said began as she campaigned, including issues with her lungs and colon that resulted in undereating and losing weight.</p>



<p>Under doctors’ care, Ivey said she’s waiting on a diagnosis.</p>



<p>“One of my doctors told me that I was malnourished,” she said.</p>



<p>Ivey isn’t sure if the pressure of the campaign played a role. </p>



<p>“I can&#8217;t say that it wasn&#8217;t, just because of the timing. I can tell you that I didn&#8217;t internally feel stressed,” she said.</p>

<p>Ivey knows campaigning. The mother of five sons and grandmother was former Maryland attorney general Doug Gansler’s running mate in his unsuccessful bid for governor in 2013. She served as a delegate in the Maryland statehouse, and her son Del. Julian Ivey followed in her footsteps. Her husband, a former Prince George’s County state’s attorney, is Rep. Glenn Ivey. The Iveys have created a political dynasty, serving at three levels of government.</p>



<p>Former Prince George’s County State’s Attorney Aisha Braveboy went on to win the county executive seat and, due to the overwhelmingly Democratic electorate, is the presumptive winner of the June general election.</p>



<p>Ivey chose not to endorse Braveboy after leaving the race but said she supports her.</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m going to help her. I&#8217;ve spoken to her a few times. I&#8217;m gonna help her be as successful as I can,” she said.</p>



<p>Ivey said Braveboy will take office during an “extraordinarily difficult time” for the county, particularly with the loss of federal government jobs under President Donald Trump.</p>



<p>“We have a hiring freeze as a county right now. Things are very tight. I mean, we&#8217;re trying to figure out how to rob Peter to pay Paul right now, and that&#8217;s before you take into account all the people who could soon be losing their jobs,” she said.</p>



<p>News4 asked Ivey if she plans to run for county executive again in a year-and-a-half.</p>



<p>“No, I don&#8217;t. I think that that was my chance and, you know, fate conspired against it, so, it&#8217;s fine,” she said.</p>

<p>While Ivey remains on the council, she lost her chairmanship in a surprise vote. She said she’s committed to remaining on the council and serving her constituents.</p>



<p>“I am determined. I&#8217;m not doing a lot of extra. You might not see me at every community event right now. But I think that people are giving me a lot of grace on that. And I&#8217;ll get there. I&#8217;m getting better. It&#8217;s just gonna take a little time,” she said.</p>



<p>Ivey said she’s not someone who regrets decisions she makes and did not feel emotional about stepping away from the county executive race because of her health. She said she was not expecting to be reelected chair but didn’t expect the vote to happen this week.</p>



<p>She is still a council member at large and said she will run again in 2026.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>A family is looking for answers after Donnell Stephenson, a 19-year-old Prince George’s County Public Schools employee, was fatally shot.</p>



<p>“We were all together having dinner as a family, he said mom I’m going outside for a quick second and that’s the last text I got from my son…” said his stepmom, Erika Stephenson.</p>



<p>Days after his death, his heartbroken family made a public plea.</p>



<p>“Numb. Numb.” Erika Stephenson said. “My husband and I keep saying we’re just waiting for him to stick his key on the door.”</p>



<p>Prince George&#8217;s County police said the 19-year-old was shot to death inside of a home on St. Michaels Drive in Mitchellville early Sunday morning.</p>



<p>“He wasn&#8217;t in the streets, he wasn&#8217;t,” said his older sister, Aniya Stephenson. “He was an innocent bystander.”</p>



<p>Tuesday, surrounded by loved ones, his sister and stepmom spoke with News4 in front of their Hyattsville home to tell the world one thing:</p>



<p>“That he has a family who loves him…” his stepmom said. “And I feel like the world, you know, social media, views him as just another young Black man, but he wasn&#8217;t. He was somebody’s brother, somebody’s son, best friend, cousin, support system.”</p>



<p>They shared family photos of the joyful teen who had a passion for photography and the Dallas Cowboys.</p>

<p>“My younger brother, but he was my big brother. He was my dad, my protector, everything I could imagine, he was there for me, like he was my first best friend,” his sister said.</p>



<p>Aniya Stephenson says even though he was younger, she always considered him her bodyguard, known for his infectious smile and sense of humor.</p>



<p>“Everybody that ever came into his space, he made them laugh, he made them feel safe,” she said.</p>



<p>“Every picture you see of him, I promise you will see all 32 of his teeth…” his stepmom said.</p>



<p>Loved ones say he took a job with Prince George&#8217;s County Public Schools in September doing maintenance at a local elementary school, a huge source of pride for his parents and four siblings.</p>



<p>“Graduated high school last year, moved on to start a career with Prince George’s County Public Schools, at 19 years old, with a pension,” said Erika Stephenson.</p>



<p>At last update, Prince George&#8217;s County police did not say much about a possible motive or suspect description for the fatal shooting.</p>



<p>“All that we’ve heard from them and from people who were there was that it wasn’t for him,” Erika Stephenson said.</p>



<p>While the investigation continues, the Stephensons’ loved ones are holding onto special memories from his prom last year and the 5k they ran together a couple weeks ago.</p>



<p>They are urging anyone who knows what happened to speak up so their grieving family can find justice.</p>



<p>“I just want people to do the right thing and say something, you know let us have a little closure,” Erika Stephenson said. “Just give us some closure.”</p>



<p>There is a $25,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest. Anyone who knows anything that can help with this case is being asked to call Prince George&#8217;s County police.</p>

<p>Three times in the past four weeks, deadly crashes in Prince George&#8217;s County have involved drivers fleeing traffic stops.</p>



<p>In each case, investigators say the drivers initially pulled over and then took off.</p>



<p>On Feb. 28 in Hyattsville, Esmeralda Montoya-Perez was killed while she waited for a bus on East West Highway in Chillum.</p>



<p>Seven days later on Addison Road South in Capitol Heights, three-year-old Zoey Harrison was killed while riding in the car with her mother.</p>



<p>And then last Friday on Martin Luther King Jr. Highway in Landover, Patrica Riddick was killed in a horrific crash while traveling through an intersection with her daughter.</p>



<p>So far, no one has been charged in any of the fatal crashes. State’s attorney Aisha Braveboy spoke about the crashes with reporters Monday.</p>



<p>“We know that these individuals did not intend to kill anyone, but when you are fleeing, when you are traveling at high rates of speed, it&#8217;s unpredictable. What happens is unpredictable.”</p>



<p>Braveboy said her office will make a decision on charges after the police investigations are completed.</p>



<p>“The police get behind you, put those things that spin red and blue, says they are taking an action to stop you, you can stop,” said Prince George’s County Police Chief Malik Aziz.</p>



<p>If Sen. Charles Sydnor of Baltimore County is successful with Senate Bill 292, officers would be precluded from making traffic stops for some minor infractions.</p>



<p>He spoke about the bill during a January hearing in Annapolis.</p>



<p>“They include the obstruction of vehicle registration license plates in any manner, driving without functioning headlights, brake lights or tail lights, driving without a mirror, with obstructed or damaged mirrors,” Sydnor said.</p>



<p>Sydnor said the bill, if passed, would reduce the racial disparity in traffic stops as well as making it safer for officers.</p>



<p>However, the bill was immediately lampooned by the sheriff in Harford County, who made fun of it in a video posted to social media.</p>



<p>So far, according to the Maryland General Assembly’s website, the bill has been referred to committee.</p>



<p>The Maryland Attorney General’s office will investigate the pursuits that led to those three deadly crashes to make sure the officers involved followed department policies.</p>



<p>The state’s attorney will determine whether the drivers face any additional charges.</p>



<p>It is not yet known if any of the pursuits were started based on any of the “minor infractions” listed in Sydnor’s bill.</p>

<p>A mother of four was killed when a driver fleeing a traffic stop slammed into her vehicle Friday night in Landover, Maryland, <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/worst-nightmare-mother-of-4-killed-by-speeding-driver-in-landover/3875546/">injuring her daughter</a> and ripping a family apart.</p>



<p>Loved ones told News4 Patricia Riddick was killed when a black Genesis slammed into her SUV at the intersection of Martin Luther King Jr. Highway and Belle Haven in Landover, Maryland.</p>



<p>“She was three minutes away from home….” said Crystal Bandy, Riddick’s mother-in-law. “Three minutes. It was the worst three minutes of our life.”</p>



<p>Disturbing surveillance video captured the moment four children lost their mother.</p>



<p>Investigators said the driver of the Genesis had taken off from a traffic stop earlier and was being chased by Prince George&#8217;s County police officers.</p>



<p>“It’s just hard,” Bandy said. “It’s not fair.”</p>



<p>She said Riddick had just picked up her daughter and was on her way home.</p>



<p>“The worst nightmare of our life,” she said. “And to me, I&#8217;m just waiting for somebody to pinch me and say it’s not, it’s just a dream, it’s not real.”</p>



<p>Days after the deadly crash, dozens of friends and family members gathered in Anacostia Park to remember the 34-year-old. Loved ones described her as a fun-loving and devoted mother.</p>



<p>“She loved her kids,” said family member Dena Wynn. “Like she would have laid down her own life for her children, her family.”</p>



<p>They said the moving memorial filled with candles and black and purple balloons comes as the family deals with another devastating tragedy in just over a year.</p>



<p>“Last year was a rough year for us because she lost both of her kids’ fathers… We’re broken. We have a 14-year-old, we have an 8-year-old, we have a 7-year-old and we have a 4-year-old that don’t have no parents…” Bandy said. “She was their everything.”</p>



<p>At last update, a rep for the Maryland Attorney General&#8217;s office did not comment on the investigation, and there was no word on the charges the driver of the Genesis will face.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">&#8216;You can stop&#8217;: Police chief asked about three deadly crashes linked to pursuits</h2>



<p>Reporters asked Prince George&#8217;s County police on Monday about three police pursuits in the past month that led to deadly crashes, including the one that killed Riddick.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/minor-dies-after-driver-fleeing-police-hits-4-cars-in-capitol-heights/3862868/">3-year-old girl died and others were injured</a> when a driver trying to speed away from police hit four cars in Capitol Heights on March 7, authorities said.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/mother-killed-by-driver-fleeing-from-hyattsville-police/3859927/">mother of two waiting for a bus on her way home</a> was hit and killed on East-West Highway as Hyattsville police followed a suspect who fled a traffic stop on Feb. 28.</p>



<p>Prince George’s Police Chief Malik Aziz said his answer is clear.</p>



<p>“The police put the red and blues on you, stop. There&#8217;s not a whole lot of discussion on that. I don&#8217;t even know how to expound even further on that,” he said. “The police get behind you, those little things that spin red and blue says they&#8217;re taking an action to stop you. You can stop. That is in your control, to stop.”</p>

<p>Night after night, men wearing masks stormed into 7-Elevens in Prince George’s County early this year and stole cash from ATMs.</p>



<p>After a long investigation, investigators believe they now know who did it.</p>



<p>Three D.C. residents in their 30s are accused of ATMs robberies in Beltsville, Lanham, Oxon Hill and Upper Marlboro starting in January, county police said Monday.</p>



<p>“Our robbery unit and our partners – they saw to it that they wouldn’t get away with this crime. … They thought they could get away with it, and we showed them they could not,” Chief Malik Aziz said at news conference.</p>



<p>Police say the men used “the jaws of life,” which usually are used to save people trapped in car crash wreckage, to pry open the machines and steal more than $257,000. They were charged in five ATM robberies and suspected in others, police said.</p>



<p>The suspects are Jeff Crews, 33; Maurice Roots, 34; and David Jerome Walker, 39.</p>



<p>Roots was arrested in Clinton on Wednesday. Crews and Walker were arrested in D.C. the next day. D.C. officers searched the suspects’ homes and found cash and guns, and recovered multiple vehicles, police said.</p>



<p>Crews and Walker are accused of robberies on:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Jan. 29 at a 7-Eleven on Cherry Hill Road in Beltsville</li>



<li>Jan. 29 at a 7-Eleven on Watkins Park Drive in Upper Marlboro</li>



<li>Feb. 1 at a 7-Eleven on Good Luck Road in Lanham</li>



<li>Feb. 6 at a 7-Eleven on Oxon Hill Road in Oxon Hill</li>



<li>Feb. 19 at a 7-Eleven on Baltimore Avenue in Beltsville</li>
</ul>



<p>Crews, Roots and Walker are accused of robberies on:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Feb. 22 at a 7-Eleven on Lanham Severn Road in Lanham</li>
</ul>



<p>Walker faces 45 charges, Crews faces 43 and Roots faces seven.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">How GPS trackers played a key role in the investigation</h2>



<p>Police cracked the case in part through the use of GPS trackers. A Lexus GS 350 was caught on video leaving one of the robberies, a court document says. Investigators were able to find the car in D.C. and put a GPS tracker on it.</p>



<p>Police had the men under surveillance for some time and had placed a second GPS tracker on a car police believed the men were using, court records say. The suspects got suspicious and were able to find and remove the tracker, police said.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">‘To me, it’s organized crime’</h2>



<p>Investigators are still trying to solve a series of ATM robberies from November 2023 in which the jaws of life also were used. Aziz said he believes investigators may link the suspects to additional crimes.</p>



<p>“We have a belief that these may grow and that they did cross state lines and that there are going to be more [charges] added to this right here. To me, it’s organized crime,” he said.</p>



<p>One of the men charged, Crews, was indicted in 2015 along with 13 others and sentenced to 10 years in prison for being part of what federal authorities called the Simple City Crew. The criminal enterprise involved carjackings and other crimes, prosecutors said.</p>



<p>Crews was released from federal prison in April 2023.</p>



<p>Detectives from the county’s robbery unit and carjacking unit were assisted by D.C. police and the Washington Area Vehicle Enforcement Team and Narcotic Enforcement Division.</p>



<p>The investigation is ongoing. Anyone with potentially relevant information is asked to call police or submit a tip anonymously.</p>

<p>The Maryland Department of Health confirmed two new cases of measles in the state.</p>



<p>The patients are Prince George&#8217;s County residents who recently traveled out of the country.</p>



<p>Health officials said the new cases are not connected to the <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/maryland-resident-has-measles-after-returning-from-international-travel/3862456/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one reported earlier this month in Howard County</a>. That case also was connected to international travel.</p>



<p>Health officials warn about potential exposure at several locations:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>March 5 at Dulles International Airport</li>



<li>March 5, 13, 15 and 17 at Kaiser Permanente Largo Medical Center</li>



<li>March 14 at Reagan National Airport and on a Metro Yellow Line train</li>



<li>March 17 at Passport Toyota in Suitland</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://health.maryland.gov/newsroom/Pages/Two-cases-of-measles-confirmed-in-Maryland-residents-with-recent-international-travel.aspx">Here&#8217;s precisely when and where people may have been exposed</a>, according to the Maryland Department of Health.</p>

<p>“The health and safety of our students and staff remain our top priority,” a statement from PGCPS read. “We are actively monitoring the situation in close coordination with PGHD, tracking cases, and implementing necessary precautions.”</p>



<p>Anyone who believes they may have been exposed — especially the unvaccinated — should monitor for symptoms for 21 days. If a fever develops, do not go to work or school and call a health care provider before going in for an office visit.</p>



<p>&#8220;Measles is a highly contagious viral infection. For individuals who have received the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine, the risk of contracting it is extremely low. However, unvaccinated individuals face a significantly higher risk of infection and complications,&#8221; the PGCPS statement said.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>A man was deported from Maryland under the Alien Enemies Act — <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/national-international/the-alien-enemies-act-what-to-know-about-a-1798-law-that-trump-has-invoked-for-deportations/3868858/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 1798 law invoked by President Donald Trump</a> — according to his wife, but she says he’s not part of a criminal organization and has protected status in the U.S.</p>



<p>The Alien Enemies Act allows the U.S. government to detain and deport nationals of an enemy nation during war or an invasion.</p>



<p>The man, who News4 refers to as Armando to protect his identity, is in prison in El Salvador, according to his wife and attorney.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, El Salvador’s president posted a video to X that Armando’s wife says shows her husband being frog walked by guards. His wife had no idea where her husband was until she recognized him in the video. She also recognized his distinctive tattoos in a photograph.</p>



<p>“This is unfair,” she said. “You just don’t go randomly picking up people and sending them and putting on a plane.”</p>



<p>According to Armando’s attorney, Lucia Curiel, 29-year-old Armando was given the status of withholding of removal in 2019. A document she provided shows the status was granted and cites a clause that provides restriction on deportation but has exceptions in which the person can be removed, such as reasonable grounds to believe the person is a danger.</p>



<p>Curiel says he is not a danger and has routinely checked in with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>



<p>“I have never heard of anything like this happening, and any other lawyer that I talked to is also, I mean, the reaction is just one of shock, because this really is just a flagrantly ignoring the law,” Curiel said. “This is completely illegal by any stretch of the imagination.”</p>



<p>News4 found no local criminal record for Armando, not even a traffic ticket.</p>



<p>However, Curiel said Armando was accused by Prince George’s County police of wearing a gang shirt in March 2019. The claim wasn’t substantiated, she said, but she believes that might be the reason Armando was targeted for deportation.</p>



<p>“I don’t know why they noticed me,” Armando told News4 through an interpreter in December 2020. “Perhaps because of my Latino race, they labeled me as a gang member, which I have never been. And I have no criminal record in my country or in the United States.”</p>



<p>ICE picked up Armando March 12 near IKEA in College Park. According to his wife, he had just left the house with his young son and was heading to the bus stop to pick up his older kids.</p>



<p>“When they put him in the vehicle, they still took me to the vehicle and opened the door and told me to say goodbye to him,” Armando’s wife said.</p>



<p>“He just old me to take care of my kids, and I told him everything is going to be fine,” she said. “You’re going to come back, because you haven’t done nothing. You have your work permit.”</p>



<p>In a recent interview with the News4 I-Team, the director of ICE operations in Maryland said everything ICE does is highly targeted.</p>



<p>Curiel believes Armando was on one of three flights that left from Texas last week. Trump said the flights had “bad people on them.”</p>



<p>“These were bad people,” Trump said. “That was a bad group of, as I say, hombres.”</p>



<p>A spokesman for ICE in Baltimore referred questions about Armando to the White House or State Department.</p>



<p>In Monday’s White House press briefing, reporters asked White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt how they determined everyone they detained had a criminal record.</p>



<p>“I can ensure the American people that customs and border patrol and ICE and the Department of Homeland Security are sure about the identities of the individuals who were on these planes and the threat that they posed to our homeland,” she said.</p>



<p>The only recourse now may be a lawsuit, Curiel said.</p>



<p>“Because the government of the United States has clearly violated his rights by deporting him to El Salvador and violated U.S. law by deporting him to El Salvador,” she said.</p>



<p>A DHS spokesperson declined to provide any criminal records or details but sent a statement in response, saying, “We are confident in DHS intelligence assessments on these gang affiliations and criminality. This administration is not going to ignore the rule of law.&#8221;</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Maryland lawmakers are reacting to President Donald Trump saying he&#8217;s stopping the relocation of the FBI to Prince George&#8217;s County.</p>



<p>This comes more than a year after the decision was made to move headquarters to Greenbelt. But now with Trump&#8217;s comments, the big move is up in the air.</p>



<p>Right now, what it’s causing is a delay in the construction process that is yet to start and could take about a decade to be completed.</p>



<p>The move would have benefited the area and its businesses, according to local leaders.</p>



<p>“We’re gonna stop it,” Trump said. “We’re gonna build another big fbi building right where it is.”</p>



<p>With this statement, president trump challenged the more than a decade-long planning process to move the FBI headquarters.</p>



<p>The GSA selected the 61-acre site near the Greenbelt Metro Station in 2023.</p>



<p>“The longer it takes to build the new FBI headquarters, the longer we are at risk for an attack there, the longer the employees and passerby at the current headquarters at risk because the building is literally falling apart and the more it’s gonna cost because as for any public project, the longer it takes to build it the more it costs to do it,” said Congressman Glenn Ivey, who represents Maryland’s fourth district.</p>



<p>The president’s comments were also refuted by Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, calling it a reckless move.</p>



<p>Zee, who works at Pop, Scoops &amp; Dough, a family business that opened just two months ago in the area, said the project would elevate the Greenbelt community.</p>



<p>“I absolutely, 100% hope that it happens because it would boost about 30,000 jobs and salary increment in our area, it would boost the tax rate and the infrastructure, which we so need in our area,” she said.</p>



<p>“This is a need that the nation has and we need to move forward with it,” Ivey added.</p>



<p>In a recently released joint statement, Ivey and other local leaders said they would continue working to ensure that the headquarters is brought to Maryland.</p>



<p>And although the president claimed, “They were gonna build an FBI headquarters three hours away in Maryland,” the new facility would only be located less than 20 miles — or 35 minutes — away from its current location on Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>



<p>According to Ivey, it now could be up to the administration and the agency to determine what happens next.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>A local news station in Prince George&#8217;s County is slated to be shut down due to budget cuts.</p>



<p>Eliminating CTV would save hundreds of thousands of dollars, but it also would mean the loss of community news coverage.</p>



<p>The station has been a training ground for young journalists and others looking to get a break in the TV industry for decades.</p>



<p>Daily newscasts air on cable as well as social media, focusing on county news, sports, entertainment and politics. The station has been a launching pad for many careers as journalists gain hands-on experience on camera, behind the camera and editing in a major, D.C.-area market.</p>



<p>“If the station is shut down, if it’s shuttered, it’s gonna be a significant loss to the community in terms of access to the community media,” said former news director Curtis Crutchfield, who worked there for more than 30 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Countless young writers, producers, photographers and reporters got experience and moved on to larger markets and affiliates.</p>



<p>“CTV is a community resource,” Crutchfield said. “If you lose that, who’s gonna replace it? What will replace it?”</p>



<p>In announcing the possible closure, acting Prince George&#8217;s County Executive Tara Jackson spoke about the dire budget outlook and the tough decisions that must be made. Under the proposal, the CTV budget would be slashed from roughly $800,000 to $900,000 down to $200,000 around September or October, and positions would be eliminated.</p>



<p>“When CTV was built, I was one of the first producers knocking on the door, looking for opportunity,” said local filmmaker Dwayne Brown, who got his start at CTV in the 1990s. “And I created a show called ‘The Breeze Country,’ which was a oldies but goodies dance show, and it launched my career. And it’s still one of the longest running shows on CTV.</p>



<p>Milly Hall, a CTV show producer for decades, plans to protest the cuts.</p>



<p>“I could not believe it when I saw it,” she said. “I’m like, CTV community television is the backbone of this whole community.”</p>



<p>The cuts must be approved by the Prince George’s County Council.</p>



<p>“Most of us want to find a way to save it,” Council Chair Jolene Ivey said. “Hopefully, we can.”</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Prince George&#8217;s County faces a massive budget deficit that&#8217;s only expected to increase in the coming years.</p>



<p>Acting County Executive Tara Jackson outlined her budget plan Thursday, attempting to close a $170 million projected shortfall.</p>



<p>The proposal includes a telecommunications tax that would raise millions of dollars and cuts to most departments. Jackson also warned of uncertainty ahead because of state budget cuts and the elimination of federal jobs and programs under President Donald Trump’s administration.</p>



<p>“This is the most difficult budget that I have faced,” Jackson said during the budget presentation.</p>



<p>The telecommunications tax on cellphones would be an additional $2.50 per month, making it a total of $3.50 for each phone line. The tax increase would generate $37 million annually.</p>



<p>The proposal also includes reductions to stormwater and litter collection programs, cuts to most departments excluding public safety, and the elimination of CTV — the county&#8217;s cable television station.</p>



<p>“Residents will feel these cuts, but they will help us maintain the fiscal responsibility that’s needed to protect our community,” Jackson said at Thursday&#8217;s presentation.</p>



<p>Jackson said the county faces uncertainty as Maryland grapples with billions of dollars in cuts and a projected shortfall. With the Trump administration’s cuts to the federal workforce and programs, there&#8217;s fear the county budget will take more hits.</p>



<p>More than 70,000 county residents work for the federal government, and the county receives about $260 million in federal grants.</p>



<p>“We must be extremely careful because of the unexpected,” Jackson said.</p>



<p>Jackson also spoke about the challenges of funding state-mandated increases to education called Blueprint funding. The county is looking at a possible $45 million increase depending on what the state legislature approves this session.</p>



<p>“We are committed to providing high-quality education for our children, but we also maintain our position that the program costs are not sustainable long term,” Jackson said.</p>



<p>She said she was careful not to take too much from the county&#8217;s reserves, only using about $10 million for one-time expenses.</p>



<p>“We do know that in times like this, you tighten up and you don&#8217;t spend what you don&#8217;t have,” Jackson said.</p>



<p>She told reporters her budget would also delay implementation of a senior tax credit if the Prince George’s County Council passes it. The council’s vice chair, Ed Burroughs III, championed the legislation, which could cost the county $13 million.</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m not going to support you continuing to give developers who don&#8217;t live here tax breaks but deny the seniors who built this county tax breaks, and so we have to make sure that we’re being consistent and fair,” Burroughs said.</p>



<p>The county currently has a hiring freeze, and the phone tax increase must be approved by the council.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Prince George&#8217;s County held a career fair for federal workers impacted by mass government layoffs.</p>



<p>More than 80 employers gathered at the University of Maryland to give job seekers a look at what new roles might be available for them.</p>



<p>Employ Prince George’s hosted the Career Transition and Resource Fair, which hundreds of former federal workers attended. Many of whom united after being blindsided by the layoffs.</p>



<p>“I did not have on my bingo card my entire career path being annihilated,” said Chris Blackwood, a former U.S. Agency for International Development worker.</p>



<p>The fair is an event Blackwood never imagined he’d have to attend. He told News4 he has a child on the way and is hoping to find a job soon.</p>



<p>“I genuinely don’t know how we&#8217;re going to pay for child support. I genuinely don’t know,” Blackwood said. “Looking around this room, seeing so many people in my same position, it’s very scary. We just live in a world of uncertainty right now.”</p>



<p>More than 2,000 people registered for the fair. Organizers told News4 it’s a bittersweet feeling for them. On one hand, they appreciate that people are taking advantage of available resources, but on the other hand, they’re disappointed they have to do this in the first place.</p>



<p>“It’s troubling,” said Walter Simmons, the president and CEO of Employ Prince George’s. “We&#8217;re hearing stories from people who worked 20, 25 years that got laid off with no notice. So it’s a heavy heart, but that’s the drive. That’s the motivation.”</p>



<p>On top of the chance to network with employers, attendees were coached on how to use LinkedIn, improve their resumes and see how they can transfer their skills to other fields.</p>



<p>“I’ve had people walk up to me and say they walked in with a heavy heart and no hope, and they’re leaving with opportunity. They’re leaving with positivity,” Simmons said.</p>



<p>Employ Prince George&#8217;s said it has made contact with about 5,000 people nationwide who were laid off. Their focus isn&#8217;t just on helping people find jobs. There were also resources available at the fair regarding rental assistance and mental healthcare for those impacted.</p>



<p>There will be another job fair in Prince George&#8217;s County on Saturday at the Suitland Community Center from noon to 4 p.m.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>A new proposal in Prince George&#8217;s County to reduce speeding in residential areas comes after a series of crashes along Allentown Road, including a fatal collision earlier this year.</p>



<p>“People speed off the main streets, and then they come into your community and your neighborhoods, and they just still have this mentality where they have to still keep speeding up,” said Fort Washington resident Darnell.</p>



<p>When he first moved in with his family 17 years ago, speed humps were installed, but Darnell believes they need an upgrade and should be installed in more locations throughout the county.</p>



<p>“It did good 17 years ago, but it’s a whole new year,” Darnell said.</p>



<p>“Sometimes at night, it’s dark in this area, and they just think they can just drive as fast as they want to,” he said.</p>



<p>Legislation introduced Tuesday by Prince George’s County Council member Ed Burroughs aims to stop speeders. It would create safeguards after a woman lost her life earlier this year when, police said, she crashed into a Fort Washington home.</p>



<p>“This bill comes out of a tragedy off of Allentown Road, where residents off Allentown Road had made several requests for traffic calming measures,” Burroughs said.</p>



<p>The measures include deterrents like street humps, speed cameras, and steeper fines for speeding and reckless driving.</p>



<p>The bill would be the first step toward action, Burroughs said.</p>



<p>“This bill standardizes the process,” he said. “It shortens the window of time in which a determination is made, and then it also puts that recommendation to the County Council for final decision.”</p>



<p>By November of last year there were more than 54 fatalities on the roads, police said, which is why some inside of the county say these steps are necessary especially in residential areas.</p>



<p>“It’s best that you have to make the speed bumps higher and then have surveillance cameras within the neighborhoods,” Darnell said.</p>



<p>“We want everybody to be safe,” he said. “We have elderly people, we have children, we have these pets that run into the street, and we don’t want any harm this year. We really don’t.”</p>



<p>A date has not been set for the community to comment.</p>

<p>A 3-year-old girl died and others were injured when a driver trying to speed away from police hit four cars in Capitol Heights Friday evening, authorities said.</p>



<p>Tanisha Robinson and her 3-year-old daughter, Zoey, were in one of the cars the suspect’s SUV hit, the Maryland Office of the Attorney General said. The mother was treated for non-life-threatening injuries at a hospital. The little girl was taken to a children&#8217;s hospital, where she was pronounced dead.</p>



<p>“My heart really goes out to the family,” Prince George’s County Council member Krystal Oriadha said. “As a new mom, I just can’t imagine driving and doing something that’s so ordinary and then one moment your child is alive and the next they&#8217;re not.”</p>



<p>A District Heights police officer attempted a traffic stop of an Infiniti SUV driver in the 6000 block of Marlboro Pike at about 6:25 p.m. Friday, the attorney general’s office said in a statement the following day. The driver initially stopped but then took off north onto Addison Road South.</p>



<p>The officer lost sight of the Infiniti and put out a description of the SUV by radio. Moments later, a District Heights officer and a Capitol Heights officer saw the SUV, turned on their emergency equipment and tried to stop the driver.</p>



<p>“A short time later,” authorities said, the driver of the Infiniti crashed into four cars in the 1200 block of Addison Road South. The driver was put in custody and taken to a hospital for injuries described as not life-threatening.</p>



<p>People in the three other cars were treated on the scene for minor injuries.</p>

<p>The suspect’s name was not immediately released, and the attorney general’s office didn’t say why police initially pulled over the SUV driver.</p>



<p>Oriadha said it’s time to rethink how police initiate pursuits.</p>



<p>“We’ve been having this conversation for a long time about what should trigger an interaction, one, with law enforcement and what should condone law enforcement chasing,” she said. “We know we have laws already in place around chasing when it comes to, like, ATVs because we know it can lead to death. And so, I think this just highlights that conversation needs to continue to happen.”</p>



<p>Investigations by the attorney general’s office and Maryland State Police Crash Team are underway. The officers involved had body cameras and dash cameras. Anyone with potentially relevant information is asked to call 410-576-7070 or email at <a href="mailto:IID@oag.state.md.us">IID@oag.state.md.us</a>.</p>

<p>A new resource is now open in Prince George&#8217;s County: the She Suite Luxury Pantry and Resource Hub.</p>



<p>The goal is to uplift, train and provide tools for women and families in need, providing professional training for women looking to enter into the workforce.</p>



<p>Every hand was hard at work on Friday, stocking supplies and hanging clothes in preparation for the grand opening.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to pour into them and meet them exactly where they are,&#8221; said Tamika Page, one of the pantry&#8217;s co-founders.</p>



<p>Page is a domestic violence survivor herself. Now, her new resource hub is open at the Shops at Iverson in Maryland.</p>



<p>She says the goal is to provide a one-stop shop for women and families of all backgrounds, especially those who may have been affected by the mass federal layoffs.</p>



<p>&#8220;We want to get to the root and heart of the need,&#8221; Page said. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to start with the food, but then we&#8217;re also going to take it into a holistic wrap-around service,&#8221; including mental health services.</p>



<p>Latoya Ball is the other part of the equation. Ball and Page have worked to help who they now consider a sisterhood of women, recently joining forces to open up shop.</p>



<p>&#8220;Partner with someone that I know is here to service the community and we always show up with an attitude of gratitude,&#8221; Ball said. &#8220;So we have the same principles and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s worked for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Family and friends are grieving after the death of Esmeralda Montoya-Perez, a 33-year-old mother of two. She was fatally struck by a car Friday night on East-West Highway in Hyattsville, Maryland, police said.</p>



<p>Montoya-Perez was waiting for a bus on her way home, said family spokesperson Ana López. It all started just after 10 p.m. down the road, when an officer pulled over a Lincoln sedan. The driver initially stopped but then sped off, Hyattsville police said.</p>



<p>Police say the officer pursued the car for a short way before calling off the chase as both cars were approaching the intersection of East-West Highway and 23rd Avenue. The Lincoln driver went through the intersection, sped onto the shoulder and hit Montoya-Perez on the side of the road, police said.</p>



<p>Police identified the driver as 23-year-old Warren Leonard. He was arrested at the scene.</p>



<p>A representative for the Maryland attorney general&#8217;s office said Leonard had an outstanding warrant for second-degree rape and had a gun with an extended magazine with him at the time of the crash.</p>



<p>Montoya-Perez&#8217;s 8-year-old daughter had been waiting at home for her mother, López said. The victim also leaves behind a 16-year-old and a devastated community.</p>



<p>Friends told Telemundo44 that Montoya-Perez was a standout on her softball team and an all-star on and off the field.</p>



<p>They organized an online fundraiser to help her grieving family, and they’re organizing a tournament in her honor this weekend.</p>

<p>Thursday at the polls in Prince George’s County, thousands turned up to vote in the special primary election primary for county executive, resulting in some long lines and long waits to vote.</p>



<p>“We were surprised, but people came out and voted, and that’s what we wanted to see anyway,” acting Elections Administrator Wendy N. Honesty-Bey said.</p>



<p>According to the Prince George’s County Board of Elections, more than 11,000 people cast their ballots in person Tuesday. Close to 10,000 voted in person early between Feb. 26 and March 3.</p>



<p>“We do have some people, we understand, that don’t like vote by mail,” Honesty-Bey said. “They want to go to the polls. They want to actually vote and have their vote counted in person.”</p>



<p>The board of elections said more than 400 people were in line at the South Bowie Community Center polling location when polls closed at 8 p.m. After polls closed, South Regional Technical had a 75-minute wait, while Southern Area Aquatic Center had a 90-minute wait.</p>



<p>Each polling location had 30 judges and workers in total. They were able to close all polls by 9:30 p.m.</p>



<p>“With the uptick in voters waiting ‘til election days, waiting ‘til that 10<sup>th</sup> hour to vote, we have to take that into consideration,” Honesty-Bey said.</p>



<p>And they’re <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/prince-georges-county/prince-georges-still-counting-ballots-as-braveboy-declares-victory-in-special-primary/3859176/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/prince-georges-county/prince-georges-still-counting-ballots-as-braveboy-declares-victory-in-special-primary/3859176/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still counting the votes</a>.</p>



<p>“As of yesterday, we had 68,000 mail-in ballots that we received, and we did early canvass on election day, about 10,000,” Honesty-Bey said. “So, about 58,000, and we’ll still get mail ballots from the post office as well that have been postmarked.”</p>



<p>With the potential for even more voters during the June general election, the board of elections said it will be prepared for in-person voting come May and June and is encouraging voters to mail in their ballots or drop them off at one of the 18 ballot drop off boxes in the county.</p>



<p>“We have to understand, again, is this a trend going forward, because that changes the dynamics on orders and supplies and everything else, so we have to look at it and see how is this going to go.”</p>



<p>Early voting for the general election takes place May 28 through June 2 with election day on June 3.</p>

<p>Election workers are still tallying the votes from <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/prince-georges-county/prince-georges-voters-to-pick-county-executive-nominees-in-special-election/3858058/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/prince-georges-county/prince-georges-voters-to-pick-county-executive-nominees-in-special-election/3858058/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tuesday&#8217;s special primary election</a> to decide who&#8217;s in the final running for Prince George&#8217;s County executive. </p>



<p>Prince George&#8217;s County State&#8217;s Attorney Aisha Braveboy declared victory in the Democratic race for county executive.</p>



<p>Braveboy had a significant 43% lead on the county&#8217;s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://elections.maryland.gov/elections/2025/SP_Primary_Results/gen_results_2025_by_county_17.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://elections.maryland.gov/elections/2025/SP_Primary_Results/gen_results_2025_by_county_17.html" target="_blank">unofficial results page</a>, which was last refreshed just before 1 a.m. Wednesday. Rushern Baker has garnered 21% of the vote and Calvin Hawkins Jr. has 20%, according to those results.</p>



<p>Both Baker and Hawkins said Wednesday they&#8217;re awaiting more votes to be counted.</p>



<p>&#8220;While current tallies may suggest a certain outcome, it is imperative to recognize that a substantial number of votes remain uncounted. We owe it to every voter to ensure that each ballot is meticulously accounted for before drawing any conclusions,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/CountyExecBaker" data-type="link" data-id="https://x.com/CountyExecBaker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baker said in a statement on X</a>. &#8220;The integrity of our democratic process hinges on this commitment. We remain steadfast in our dedication to upholding the principles of fairness and accuracy in this election.&#8221;</p>



<p>“At this time, while the current totals may suggest an unfavorable outcome, I am not conceding. A significant number of votes remain uncounted, and it is crucial to let the electoral process unfold properly and transparently,&#8221; Hawkins said in a statement Wednesday. &#8220;Every vote matters, and the integrity of our democracy depends on ensuring that each ballot is carefully counted and verified.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleven candidates, including eight Democrats and three Republicans, campaigned for the position left open after Angela Alsobrooks was elected to the U.S. Senate.</p>



<p>At last check, George E. McDermott was in the lead for the Republican nomination with nearly 34% of the vote.</p>



<p>The winner of the Democratic nomination is heavily favored to win the June general election in the majority blue county.</p>



<p>Braveboy&#8217;s supporters appeared excited and, at times, anxious as they watched numbers come in during her election party Tuesday night.</p>



<p>&#8220;As we look ahead, we have some challenging times in Prince George&#8217;s County. We do. But with your support, with your voices … we will see better tomorrows,&#8221; Braveboy told the crowd.</p>



<p>Hawkins, who was a front-runner for the Democratic nomination, told News4 Tuesday night he&#8217;s well prepared to become county executive.</p>



<p>&#8220;For the last six years, I&#8217;ve been intricately a part of moving Prince George&#8217;s County forward. From the 14 brand-new schools we&#8217;ve built, to the resources we have given our teachers and the professional training opportunities we have given. From expanding what we are doing in public safety, how we&#8217;re addressing the budget challenges,&#8221; Hawkins said.</p>



<p>The general election is June 3.</p>

<p>An 86-year-old Charles County man has been missing since going for his afternoon walk in chilly weather three weeks ago.</p>



<p>LaWan Bowman said she kept her father, Richard Wilson Jr., on the phone for hours when he didn’t return home Jan. 25, trying to get him to describe his whereabouts as police from four agencies frantically searched for him on foot and from the air.</p>



<p>“We had him on the phone for four hours,” she said. “The police officers were there at the house. One officer had the opportunity to talk with him. And I asked were there any homes or stores or anything near him, and he told me no. He said that he had slipped on some ice, the ice had cracked. So, he was wet, and I could hear him blowing in his hands, trying to keep his hands warm.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Wilson, a great-grandfather, couldn’t be found.</p>



<p>For days, police divers, search dogs and officers on four-wheelers scoured areas along the Potomac River near the Tantallon community in Prince George’s County, where Wilson’s cellphone data placed him.</p>



<p>Wilson has memory issues and vision problems, Bowman said. She believes he may have been trying to walk from Waldorf to the Eastover Shopping Center in Oxon Hill, where his daughters take him once a month to play lottery and keno.</p>



<p>Wilson is 5-feet-6-inches tall and weighs about 150 pounds. He may be wearing a tan winter coat, blue hat and blue jeans.</p>



<p>Anyone who sees him should call police immediately.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Prince George&#8217;s County Council and school board members held an emergency &#8220;state of the schools&#8221; town hall Tuesday night to address community concerns.</p>



<p>The meeting comes after several violent incidents at county schools over the past eight months.</p>



<p>Last June, Potomac High School in Oxon Hill became a deadly crime scene, when a 33-year-old man was shot and killed at a football fundraiser. A 5-year-old boy was injured.</p>



<p>In September 2024, someone fired shots near a group of Gwynn Park High School students as they waited for their school bus along Livingston Road in Accokeek. No one was hit, but police say the shooters robbed some of the students of their shoes.</p>



<p>Just two weeks ago, High Point High School in Beltsville was on lockdown for hours after a report of someone armed with a gun. It all stemmed from a fight between multiple students. Video obtained by News4 shows someone running toward the school with what appeared to be a handgun in his hand. Police, however, did not find a gun.</p>



<p>Now, one mother is demanding action after she said her child was attacked in school.</p>



<p>“My child still hasn&#8217;t got justice from being brutally attacked in a utility closet,” Juanita Caldwell said.</p>



<p>Caldwell said the past three months have been a nightmare for her daughter.</p>



<p>“They ruined my baby’s first year of high school. They ruined my child’s first year of high school…” she said. “It’s just been traumatic. We didn&#8217;t get to enjoy Christmas, we didn&#8217;t get to enjoy new year.”</p>



<p>Back in December, the 14-year-old freshman was assaulted by a group of students at Potomac High School. Caldwell said the attack left scars that may never go away.</p>



<p>“I pulled my child out of school, all the way out of school,” she said. “She’s currently doing online school at this time, and she physically has recovered, but she still is being bullied by these same children.”</p>



<p>That’s why she joined dozens of concerned community members for this emergency state of schools town hall at the William Beanes Community Center.</p>

<p>District 7 Council Member Krystal Oriadha hosted the panel with the sheriff, superintendent and several board members to answer questions about how local leaders are working to keep students safe.</p>



<p>“Being a new mom myself, I couldn&#8217;t imagine feeling like my child wasn&#8217;t safe, and I would do anything and advocate for them, so I truly understand…” Oriadha said. “And so that’s why this was important to me. I have the position to bring the stakeholders to the table.”</p>



<p>Before the Q &amp; A, school leaders touched on how recent executive orders will impact federal funding for the school district and immigration policy, as well as mental health services that are available to students.</p>



<p>“Potomac [High School] is a death trap…” Caldwell said.</p>



<p>She said she will have to see some big changes before she sends her daughter back.</p>



<p>“I want to see some action because all of our children are in danger, not just my child,&#8221; she said. </p>



<p>The county does have a task force for truancy and another for gun violence, but Oriadha says going forward she would like to set up a working group of parents and local leaders that specifically focuses on school safety.</p>

<p>Prince George&#8217;s County Council Chair Jolene Ivey unexpectedly dropped out of the race for county executive Wednesday.</p>



<p>Ivey was considered a leading candidate in the race to replace former County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, who now serves in the U.S. Senate.</p>



<p>In a statement posted to her Facebook page today, Ivey said: &#8220;I want to thank all of my volunteers and supporters for standing with me. I look forward to continue fighting for the people of Prince George’s County as a member of the County Council.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ivey suspended her campaign just weeks before a March 4 primary election.</p>



<p>She was among several well-known names in Prince George&#8217;s County campaigning for the job.</p>



<p>Internal polling consistently placed her in the top five likely to succeed Alsobrooks. The others are Prince George&#8217;s County State&#8217;s Attorney Aisha Braveboy, former County Executive Rushern Baker, at-large Council member Calvin Hawkins and Maryland state Sen. Alonzo Washington.</p>



<p>The race also includes Tonya Sweat, Marcellus Crews, Ron Hunt, Albert Slocum and Jonathan White.</p>



<p>The general election is scheduled for June.</p>

<p>WSSC Water lifted a <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/southern-prince-georges-county-under-boil-water-advisory-shuts-down-several-schools/3841414/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/southern-prince-georges-county-under-boil-water-advisory-shuts-down-several-schools/3841414/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boil water advisory</a> for thousands of customers in southern Prince George&#8217;s County after tests found water there is safe to consume following a water main break.</p>



<p>A 54-inch water main broke at 1 a.m. Tuesday morning in a heavily wooded area past the Outer Loop of the Beltway. Crews had to search for the break, driving around in the dark in the area where they believed it to be until they found it, said Lyn Riggins of WSSC Water.</p>



<p>Complicating repairs, crews had to build an access road and a bridge over a small stream to get to the break, Riggins said. Crews worked throughout the night in heavy snowfall to install the bridge and put the final piece in place as heavy snow blanketed the region.</p>



<p>WSSC offered drinking water at distribution centers Tuesday and Wednesday.  </p>

<p>Several thousand customers were affected in southern Prince George&#8217;s County. The advised area was first identified as all areas south of Pennsylvania Avenue (MD 4) but later included communities north and east of Pennsylvania Avenue. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What&#8217;s next?</h2>



<p>WSSC Water wants customers who were affected to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Begin with a sink faucet on the lowest ﬂoor.</li>



<li>Slowly open the cold water sink faucet. Opening slowly allows for the release of trapped air and may reduce the banging noise, known as a “water hammer” that can occur when water ﬂow and pressure changes.</li>



<li>Repeat on each ﬂoor, moving from lowest to highest, only opening cold water sink faucets.</li>



<li>Once the water runs clear, usually in 5 minutes or less, turn off faucets in the same order, lowest to highest.</li>



<li>You should also ﬂush your refrigerator’s water lines.</li>



<li>Customers and businesses should also dispose of stored water, drinks, or ice made since the BWA. The next three batches of ice should also be thrown out. Ice maker containers should be wiped clean with a solution of two tablespoons of bleach to one gallon of water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thousands of WSSC Water customers in southern Prince George&#8217;s County are advised to boil their water before consuming it after a large water main broke.</p>



<p>Customers should continue boiling their water for a full minute before using it for drinking, brushing teeth, making baby formula and other consumption, WSSC said early Wednesday.</p>



<p>A 54-inch water main broke at 1 a.m. Tuesday morning in a heavily wooded area past the Outer Loop of the Beltway. Crews had to search for the break, driving around the area where they believed it to be in the dark until they found it, said Lyn Riggins of WSSC Water. <a href="https://gisportal.wsscwater.com/alerts/">Here&#8217;s an interactive map of the affected area.</a></p>



<p>Complicating repairs, crews had to build an access road and a bridge over a small stream to get to the break, Riggins said.</p>



<p>Crews worked throughout the night in heavy snowfall to install the bridge and put the final piece in place as heavy snow blanketed the region.</p>



<p>WSSC is set to distribute clean drinking water at distribution centers on Wednesday and are open until 5 p.m. Wednesday. They are located at 6336 Rosecroft Drive in Fort Washington, Maryland and 11000 Thrift Road in Clinton, Maryland.  </p>



<p>&#8220;WSSC Water is working closely with our Prince George’s County partners to stand up a third location today and will provide an update once that location is confirmed and open,&#8221; WSSC&#8217;s statement said.</p>

<p>Several thousand customers are affected in southern Prince George&#8217;s County. </p>



<p>Service is slowly being restored to customers who lost water, but when the water is back on, the boil water advisory continues.</p>

<p>The advised area was first identified as all areas south of Pennsylvania Avenue (MD 4) but now includes communities north and east of Pennsylvania Avenue. </p>



<p>Riggins said that crews have turned off the water main&#8217;s valves and started repairs.</p>



<p>&#8220;Safety is mission critical, so we&#8217;re not going to do anything that&#8217;s going to jeopardize the safety of the motorists or the crews, but we are going to work as diligently, as smart as we possibly can to make these repairs,&#8221; Riggins said. </p>

<p>An 86-year-old man who has Alzheimer&#8217;s disease has been missing from Waldorf, Maryland, since Saturday, authorities say.</p>



<p>The family of Richard Wilson Jr. reported him missing Saturday evening after they discovered he was not at home in the Constitution Hills area off McDaniel Road, according to the Charles County Sheriff&#8217;s Office. Wilson is believed to have left home before 4 p.m. Saturday. </p>



<p>He is 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighs 150 pounds, the sheriff&#8217;s office said. He may be wearing clothes similar to those shown in a photo released by the sheriff&#8217;s office: blue jeans, a blue hat and a tan winter coat.</p>







<p>The sheriff&#8217;s office said Wilson may have a cellphone with him but could be unable to use it. They described him as a &#8220;critical missing person.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The last information received indicated that he may be in the Fort Washington area,&#8221; the Charles County Sheriff&#8217;s Office posted on social media Sunday evening.</p>

<p>Officials in Prince George’s County, Maryland, vowed to do a better job clearing roads after a snowstorm.</p>



<p>The County Council held a public hearing Tuesday looking into why so many neighborhoods went unplowed for days after a winter storm earlier this month. Many neighborhoods were impassible due to icy conditions after the storm.</p>



<p>Cynthia McArthur-Parker said she was stuck in her Fort Washington home unable to drive anywhere for 10 days.</p>



<p>“I’m a widow. I’m 70 years old. I shouldn’t have to go through that in order to make sure I can get out,” she said.</p>



<p>Officials with the Department of Public Works and Transportation listened to residents’ concerns and answered questions from the County Council about what went wrong. They said the duration of the storm meant it took them much longer to be able to treat main roads, which meant more ice was caked on by the time crews made it to residential streets. Since the temperatures were so low, the type of salt that was used on the roads wasn&#8217;t as effective. DPWT said it purchased a different kind of salt mixture that works better for colder conditions. But ultimately, they said their biggest challenge is getting more equipment.</p>



<p>“The need for larger trucks to service those main roads that then free us up to sort of concurrently work in the residential areas,” DPWT Director Michael Johnson said.</p>



<p>Many voiced concerns that their complaints to 311 were never answered or they were told they would get a response several days later.</p>



<p>“We just want the service to be done,” McArthur-Parker said. “I’m not asking you for a favor. I’m asking you for something that you promised me you would do when we paid our taxes.”</p>



<p>Residents said they hope DPWT can improve its communication with the public.</p>



<p>“So we can understand what the delay is and we can kind of have an understanding of what’s going on, because it just gets frustrating, confusing to just be waiting in your home,” Kettering resident Frederica Bailey said.</p>



<p>DPWT said it also had a major issue with its snowplow tracker, which would show that a neighborhood had been plowed when in fact that wasn&#8217;t the case. Officials said they fixed that problem and were able to test it out during the snowfall on Sunday.</p>

<p>A missing mother’s body was found entombed in a Prince George’s County home, and her boyfriend has been charged with murder.</p>



<p>Alexis Schuler, 29, was reported missing to D.C. police last week. On Sunday, Prince George’s County police executed a search warrant at the home of 30-year-old Devontae Gray in the 700 block of Larchmont Avenue in Capitol Heights.</p>



<p>Police found Schuler’s body in a makeshift tomb under the stairs of the home, according to charging documents.</p>



<p>Her body was in a bin that was wrapped in plastic. Gray poured concrete around the bin, placed drywall around it and laid faux bricks on the drywall, investigators. Schuler was found under a large amount of soil and hay.</p>



<p>Gray, who is the father of one of Schuler’s children, initially denied involvement but then confessed to the crime, allegedly saying he killed her during a dispute, police said.</p>



<p>“The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner determined that the victim had been shot,” Prince George’s County Police Chief Malik Aziz said. “Devontae Gray was taken into custody at the scene. When questioned, Gray confessed to murdering Miss Schuler.”</p>



<p>It wasn’t the first time officers went to the home for domestic violence, police said.</p>



<p>“Alexis will be deeply missed, and there is a void in our family,” said Schuler’s cousin Derrick Felder at a news conference. “Her three children will no longer feel their mother’s embrace or hear their mother’s voice. And all she wanted was to come home to them.”</p>



<p>Gray waived a court appearance Tuesday and is being held in jail.</p>



<p>Police and prosecutors say anyone involved in an abusive or violent relationship should leave and get help. In Prince George&#8217;s County, resources are available at the Family Justice Center.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>A Maryland town filed a lawsuit in its battle with a neighboring town over an old hospital site slated for redevelopment.</p>



<p>Bladensburg is trying to annex the site, which Cheverly claims is an attempt to derail the project. Now, Cheverly filed two court actions claiming Bladensburg&#8217;s attempts to annex the abandoned hospital site is illegal.</p>



<p>The lawsuit takes the ongoing land dispute to a new level, claiming Bladensburg has a &#8220;long held animosity and jealousy&#8221; of Cheverly and trying to annex the property on the eve of its redevelopment is &#8220;driven solely by jealousy and spite.&#8221;</p>



<p>“I can understand people thinking it&#8217;s pretty dramatic. It is,” Cheverly Mayor Kayce&nbsp;Munyeneh said. “Every day is not a day where you see municipalities suing each other. And for that I think it&#8217;s unfortunate.”</p>



<p>Cheverly claims Bladensburg wants to &#8220;terminate this development project,&#8221; which is expected to bring in tens of millions of dollars in future tax revenue.</p>



<p>In a separate complaint, Cheverly claims fraud and seeks $40 million in punitive damages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cheverly planned to annex the 44-acre property after it was turned into a $500 million upscale development with commercial and residential space.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;ve worked closely with them for years, and so if they have to go back to the drawing board, it could severely delay or completely derail the project,” Munyeneh said.</p>



<p>Cheverly still hopes its neighboring municipality will drop its plans, but Bladensburg Mayor Takisha James told News4 last month the town isn&#8217;t backing down. It’s looking for ways to grow its own tax base.</p>



<p>“So, any assertions that this was automatically going to be Cheverly’s are false,” she said.</p>



<p>Munyeneh pushed back on perceptions Cheverly is getting favored treatment with the project, saying the developer Urban Atlantic&#8217;s desire to work with her town makes economic sense.</p>



<p>“If I&#8217;m a developer of properties, I want to develop where I’m going to make the most bang for my buck,” Munyeneh said. “The property values are higher in Cheverly than that of Bladensburg. That&#8217;s just a fact.”</p>



<p>The complaint argues Bladensburg doesn&#8217;t border the hospital site like Cheverly does, it didn&#8217;t properly follow the public hearing process and it’s trying to wrongly annex part of the Baltimore Washington Parkway.</p>



<p>Bladensburg’s annexation plan passed and is set to go into effect next month.</p>



<p>Cheverly hopes a judge will stop it before it gets that far.</p>



<p>Bladensburg sent News4 a statement reading, in part, &#8220;The Town of Bladensburg stands firmly behind the fairness and legality of the annexation process conducted by the Town Council. We remain committed to upholding the principles of transparency and equity in all our actions and will not engage in divisive rhetoric or inflammatory exchanges to sway the whims of the court of public opinion.</p>



<p>&#8220;We look forward to answering the complaint filed by Cheverly and firmly believe that we have conducted the annexation in question in accordance with the law,&#8221; the statement said.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>WSSC Water has lifted an essential-water-use-only request affecting Montgomery and Prince George&#8217;s County.</p>



<p>&#8220;The water distribution system demand and pressure have stabilized, and water storage levels have returned to normal. The Potomac and Patuxent Water Filtration Plants continue to produce water, meeting customer demand,&#8221; WSSC said in a statement.</p>



<p>WSSC Water had issued an urgent request on Sunday asking its 1.9 million customers in Montgomery and Prince George&#8217;s counties to only use water for essential needs. </p>



<p>Frigid temperatures have contributed to a significant increase in water main breaks and leaks, WSSC Water said. Crews were responding to 63 breaks and/or leaks across a 1,000-square-mile service area, the company said.</p>



<p>&#8220;As soon as we fix one, another one comes in. So we are working around the clock with our crews,&#8221; WSSC Water spokesperson Lynn Riggins told News4 on Monday.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hopefully everybody kinda realizes that everything will go more smoothly if we all kind of limit our take a little bit,&#8221; said Madison Morton, a resident of Prince George&#8217;s County had told News4.</p>



<p>For some business owners, however, cutting back on water wasn&#8217;t so simple.</p>



<p>&#8220;Restaurants, you just go through so much water usage,&#8221; said Wesley Yao, the owner of Kusshi Sushi in North Bethesda.</p>



<p>Yao said they tried to be mindful of how often they run the dishwasher.</p>



<p>&#8220;Our biggest water usage is probably when we filet fish. So right now we’re fileting all our fish at the same time. Usually, we do it anyways to save water, and then just do one cleanup afterwards,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Residents can contact WSSC Water’s Emergency Services Center at (301) 206-4002 to report any running water or if they smell chlorine, which is used to disinfect drinking water. WSSC Water customers can also make reports via the <a href="https://www.wsscwater.com/mobile">WSSC Water Mobile App</a> using the &#8220;report a problem&#8221; feature.</p>

<p>A woman and two men were shot Saturday inside a home in Clinton, Maryland, and the shooter is still on the loose.</p>



<p>Police say a man with a gun went into a home in the 8800 block of Clayton Lane and opened fire on three people, including a man who was in a wheelchair. Police say it appears the shooter knew at least one person inside the house, but so far, no one has been arrested.</p>



<p>The victims are in stable condition. </p>



<p>Initial reports indicated the shooter may have gotten into a pickup truck.</p>



<p>A short time later, police found a pickup truck on fire at the intersection of Marlboro Pike and William Beanes Road. However, police have not yet confirmed whether that is the pickup they were looking for.</p>



<p>Authorities said they don&#8217;t think the shooting was random, but the motive is unclear.</p>



<p>Residents in the neighborhood told News4 that the victims generally keep to themselves and they don&#8217;t know them well. They said they&#8217;re very surprised this happened in their neighborhood, which has been safe, and that they&#8217;ve been happy living here.</p>

<p>Crime was down overall in Prince George&#8217;s County, Maryland, last year, but the chief of police says there’s still work to do.</p>



<p>Total crime is down by 9% in the county, Chief Malik Aziz said. Violent crime is down 3%, and homicides are down 5%.</p>



<p>“But if the stats say one thing and you don’t feel another, that’s a problem that we have to work on,” Aziz said. “Not just with stats, but with perception.”</p>



<p>Aziz said they&#8217;ve made a lot of progress in reducing carjackings, which are down 33%, with 147 juveniles arrested for the crime last year.</p>



<p>“Young people, especially, started using carjackings as a means to get from one place to another,” he said.</p>



<p>Stolen vehicles were down 24%.&nbsp;Aziz said efforts to stop the thefts of Kias and Hyundais helped.&nbsp;The distribution of anti-theft devices and software changes combatted the TikTok challenge that escalated thefts across the country.</p>



<p>“A lot of our young people were doing this out of fun,” Aziz said. “Others were doing it to commit these thefts to commit other crimes.”</p>



<p>An area where police saw big increases was assaults without a weapon – like fights. They were up 18%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The county saw an increase in some thefts by 14%, largely due to an explosion across the country in organized retail theft and shoplifting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Juvenile&nbsp;crime continues to be a problem, Aziz said. Investigators are focusing on a small number of kids committing what he called hardcore crimes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You can&#8217;t let everybody go,” he said. “Everybody gets dressed up. Put on a nice suit and tie, your fine clothes, and they speak real well, and they tell you what a great person they’re going to be in the future. And then they&#8217;re right back out playing the system.”</p>



<p>Prince George’s County police took more than 1,500 guns off the streets in 2024, including almost 200 ghost guns.</p>



<p>Prince George’s County police have not adopted the use of drones as a crimefighting tool because there&#8217;s so much restricted air space, especially around Joint Base Andrews in Camp Springs.</p>



<p>“When someone is using a drone program in some other city or outside the restricted area, they can do things that we can&#8217;t do,” Aziz said. </p>

<p>A family received much-needed home improvements with the help of Prince George’ County.</p>



<p>A roofing crew started early in Capitol Heights to help Towanna Wright, her daughter and her two grandchildren. Wright moved there in 2006 and bought the house in 2009.</p>



<p>The family loves the home, but it needed repair.</p>



<p>“The issues have been back and forth as far as the roof leaking, just different things, and being a senior and trying to handle and take care of everything, it was kind of hard,” Wright said.</p>



<p>A trusted friend, Phyllis Wright, saw the leaks firsthand.</p>



<p>“So, when it rains outside, it’s raining in her house, as well,” she said. “So, I knew we had to do something.”</p>



<p>She alerted at-large Prince George’s County Council member Calvin Hawkins, who used money from his community fund and found the right contractor.</p>



<p>“We vet these seniors and we vet the citizens to find out how we can help, what we can do to help,” Hawkins said.</p>



<p>“The damage was severe, severe because it was a lot of multiple shingles already missing on the roof, which means that when shingles are missing, water comes in,” said Paul Lindsay of Lindsay Roofing Services.</p>



<p>Lindsay Roofing Services joined forces with the county to fix the roof.</p>



<p>“She has a minimum 30 years,” Lindsay said. “Don’t have to worry about it, for sure. The newer material is going to be 30-year warranty. She’s going to get long out of it, and it’s almost, pretty much maintenance free.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Joy and happiness knowing that God has came in, and just the joy of it all to know that it is all here and taken place,” Towanna Wright said.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>A man was fatally shot and a woman was injured on New Year&#8217;s Eve outside a gas station in Landover, Maryland.</p>



<p>Hours before the New Year&#8217;s countdown, Prince George’s County police officers surrounded an Exxon gas station in the 7500 block of Landover Road, where someone opened fire about 8 p.m. </p>



<p>The man who died, 27-year-old Michael Shipman Jr., of Washington, D.C., was found shot inside a vehicle, police said. He was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>



<p>Officers also found a woman suffering from gunshot wounds. She was taken to a hospital in stable condition.</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t immediately clear what led up to the shooting. Several evidence markers were set up in the parking lot as detectives worked to find a motive and suspect or suspects.</p>



<p>Workers inside the business said police were reviewing surveillance video.</p>



<p>The deadly shooting brings the number of homicides in the county to 114 in 2024, a slight drop from the year before, which had more than 119 homicides.</p>



<p>&#8220;One homicide is too many, so you know families are grieving,&#8221; Prince George&#8217;s County Police Chief Malik Aziz said.</p>



<p>&#8220;The stats of homicides being down, or we’re trying to drive them down, one at the start of the year starts the progress of one too many,&#8221; Aziz said.</p>



<p>Aziz spoke with News4 earlier in 2024 about strategies, including the gun crimes unit, to address the homicide rates in Prince George&#8217;s County.</p>



<p>&#8220;We’re going to try to continue to mitigate those with the help of the community, with some great police work and in joining with municipalities, interagency departments,” he said.</p>



<p>Both police and the Prince George’s County state’s attorney say collaboration helps to address both conviction and homicide closure rates.</p>



<p>&#8220;They are second to none when it comes to solving homicides,&#8221; Prince George’s County state’s attorney Aisha Braveboy said. &#8220;And my homicide unit, headed bySherrie Waldrup, is second to none when it comes to prosecuting these cases. We work very well together.&#8221;</p>



<p>Police say the homicide closure rate has also increased. In 2024, the agency closed 79% of homicide cases, compared to 71% the year before.</p>



<p>&#8220;We just want to make sure that we are doing everything that we can, our due diligence, to bring people to justice and bring resolutions to family who are affected by it,” Aziz told News4.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>A fire ripped through an apartment complex on Christmas Day in Suitland, Maryland, leaving nearly a dozen families displaced.</p>



<p>Cellphone video shows flames shooting through the roof of the apartment building on Curtis Drive. The fire broke out around 5:45 p.m. as families were having dinner and spending time together.</p>



<p>Fire investigators say everyone was able to get out safely. Residents in two buildings were affected by the fire. There was smoke and water damage, and at least a dozen families are getting assistance from the Red Cross, including food, water, blankets and longer term resources.</p>



<p>“That includes financial assistance. It includes mental health support for those who need someone to speak with, someone to talk to, and other recovery resources like replacing eyeglasses, replacing medication,” said Bethany Bray Patterson with the American Red Cross.</p>



<p>Officials say there are more fire hazards around the holidays, from cooking to heating sources to Christmas trees that haven&#8217;t been properly watered.</p>



<p>“Folks are cooking more around the holidays, inviting their families over there; they&#8217;re cooking; we have a lot of open flames with candles and heating sources,” said Assistant Chief Donald Fletcher with Prince George’s County Fire and EMS. “As the temperatures get colder out, we&#8217;ll see a lot of space heater fires.”</p>



<p>With that in mind, firefighters returned to the apartment complex Thursday to speak to residents, provide fire safety information and remind them of the sometimes hidden fire dangers that come with the holiday season.</p>



<p>The cause of the fire is under investigation, and residents are receiving help finding new housing.</p>



<p>Anyone affected by the fire can call 1-800-RED-CROSS for assistance.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>This cold Christmas Eve was even more uncomfortable for hundreds of residents of a condominium complex in Maryland. They say they have been without heat since mid-December.</p>



<p>Residents of Chelsea Wood Condominiums in Greenbelt told News4 they’ve been informed it could be another couple of weeks, at minimum, until their homes are warm again.</p>



<p>Coats and hats are indoor survival gear now at Chelsea Wood.</p>



<p>Everett said space heaters are no real solution to the problem, because they stress the electrical systems of her unit and others.</p>



<p>“If you are plugging in more than one, your fuses are going to blow,” resident Jennifer Everett said. “It’s a shame for people that have babies, animals, older adults who depend on this.”</p>



<p>A letter from RCN Management posted near the mailboxes in each building of the Chelsea Wood complex says the company is trying to address the heating problem, which involves a broken pipe, and that repairs could extend well into January.</p>



<p>The letter also notes the company will no longer manage the complex after Dec. 31 and that a new company will take over.</p>



<p>Tonyia Thompson, who suffers from sciatica that’s made worse by being cold, said she is extremely discouraged.</p>



<p>“I have on a sweat suit on double down ,” she said. “And then I had two and three throws on my knees to protect because of my pain and everything like that.”</p>



<p>News4 reached out to the management company for comment and awaits a reply.</p>

<p>He’s a small dog out there in a big world.</p>



<p>A 3-month-old puppy named Benji was stolen Friday, along with his family’s car, at a Wawa in Forestville, Maryland.</p>



<p>“He’s tiny,” said KerryAnn Wiltshire, one of Benji’s owners. “He’s very, very tiny, very loving.”</p>



<p>Wiltshire says she and her boyfriend were driving from New York to North Carolina Friday when they stopped at a Wawa near the Ritchie Station Shopping Center in Prince George’s County to get gas and use the restroom. She says they turned off the engine and locked the black Nissan Altima with Benji, a Peekapoo, inside.</p>



<p>But when they left the store a few minutes later:</p>



<p>“We came out and we see a guy with a mask on and gloves running towards the car. He gets in the car and drives off,” Wiltshire said. “When he drove off, we start running trying to chase after the car. I guess he had an SUV behind him, so we call police.”</p>



<p>The Nissan was recovered in the District Sunday. Wiltshire says none of her belongings were found in it.</p>



<p>“The most important thing in that vehicle was not a thing, it was my son Benji, my dog. I had my dog, gifts for the kids, clothing, my phone, a thousand dollars, my ID, bank cards” she said.</p>



<p>Wiltshire says it would be a miracle if Benji could be reunited with her children, who are ages 5, 7 and 9.</p>

<p>The launch of a new program for expecting mothers aims to tackle the maternal health crisis in Prince George’s County.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Expecting mothers Chinonso Udenwani and Sandra Makito say the sense of community paired with health tips has helped prepare them for pre- and post-pregnancy. </p>



<p>“Experiencing it with other women rather than just going through it myself and just a regular appointment by myself, and the OBGYN or the midwife,” Udenwani said. </p>



<p>Luminis Health launched the nationally recognized program to support pregnant mothers and their families while addressing maternal mortality rates for Black women in Prince George&#8217;s County. </p>



<p>“We’re learning a lot, especially about our bodies, and the baby once the baby is here, how we’re supposed to handle the baby,” Makito said. </p>



<p>According to Luminis Health, maternal mortality rates for Black women rates inside the county were 50% higher than the national average. </p>



<p>Ashley Ayu, nurse practitioner at Luminis Health, said the more people join, the more normal pregnancy becomes for expecting mothers and said the sessions offer a little bit more than regular prenatal care. </p>



<p>“Get more time with the provider versus a 15-minute appointment,&#8221; Ayu said. &#8220;You get two hours with the provider. We also have speakers that come in, doulas, lactation consultants, pediatricians.” </p>



<p>Participants are more likely to have a lower risk of having a preterm or low-birth-weight baby, make healthier lifestyle choices, and maintain a healthy weight during pregnancy. </p>



<p>“Not just understanding my body, but also understanding what I&#8217;m going through,&#8221; Makito said. &#8220;And it’s not just me.” </p>
