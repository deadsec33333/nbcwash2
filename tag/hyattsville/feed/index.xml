<p>A Hyattsville, Maryland, apartment building housing students from nearby colleges and universities has been determined “unfit” for residents by the city.</p>



<p>Students said they’d been without water and power in the high-rise building for multiple days.</p>



<p>Vie Towers told News4 the problem stems from the property’s electrical panel.</p>



<p>Residents say they’ve experienced low or no water pressure in their units, coupled with power outages that occurred since at least Friday.</p>



<p>With elevators not working, residents have been forced to climb stairwells some say are dark and dangerous.</p>



<p>Hyattsville said its code compliance team went to the property Tuesday morning after receiving several complaints in the building. They posted green signs on the property declaring the building “unfit for human habitation.” The signs order the property be vacated and remain that way until provisions of the order are complied with or the order has been withdrawn.</p>



<p>The city said it will fine the property $500 each day until the issues are fixed. The city said it cannot mandate residents leave the apartment, but the notice served to make residents aware of the situation.</p>



<p>“Vie Towers experienced significant damage to the building’s main electrical panel, impacting mechanical system,” the company said in a statement to News4.</p>



<p>Vie Towers said to expedite solutions, they are installing a temporary generator to restore power to the mechanical systems while they await “necessary parts for permanent repairs.” The building added they have already restored power to individual units.</p>



<p>Residents said students from the University of Maryland, Howard University and Prince George’s Community College live in the building.</p>



<p>“The most miserable thing is having to smell actual urine and feces in the hallways because some people are not able to flush their toilets. I think that’s very nasty, unhygienic and it’s just very unfit to live,” said Brooke, a senior at Howard.</p>



<p>Howard told News4 it&#8217;s aware of the “challenges” at the building after a severe power outage Sunday. Building management is working to immediately restore services, to Howard&#8217;s knowledge.</p>



<p>Howard has a lease agreement with property management to provide residential space for 45 students, the university said, and its student affairs team has been in “continuous communication” with the property management company. The team was on site to coordinate support services for Howard students, including alternative housing if needed.</p>

<p>Family and friends are grieving after the death of Esmeralda Montoya-Perez, a 33-year-old mother of two. She was fatally struck by a car Friday night on East-West Highway in Hyattsville, Maryland, police said.</p>



<p>Montoya-Perez was waiting for a bus on her way home, said family spokesperson Ana López. It all started just after 10 p.m. down the road, when an officer pulled over a Lincoln sedan. The driver initially stopped but then sped off, Hyattsville police said.</p>



<p>Police say the officer pursued the car for a short way before calling off the chase as both cars were approaching the intersection of East-West Highway and 23rd Avenue. The Lincoln driver went through the intersection, sped onto the shoulder and hit Montoya-Perez on the side of the road, police said.</p>



<p>Police identified the driver as 23-year-old Warren Leonard. He was arrested at the scene.</p>



<p>A representative for the Maryland attorney general&#8217;s office said Leonard had an outstanding warrant for second-degree rape and had a gun with an extended magazine with him at the time of the crash.</p>



<p>Montoya-Perez&#8217;s 8-year-old daughter had been waiting at home for her mother, López said. The victim also leaves behind a 16-year-old and a devastated community.</p>



<p>Friends told Telemundo44 that Montoya-Perez was a standout on her softball team and an all-star on and off the field.</p>



<p>They organized an online fundraiser to help her grieving family, and they’re organizing a tournament in her honor this weekend.</p>

<p>The attorney general’s office said the officer had a body-worn camera and dashboard camera and said body camera video is typically released less than three weeks later.</p>

<p>A Hyattsville, Maryland, apartment building housing students from nearby colleges and universities has been determined “unfit” for residents by the city.</p>



<p>Students said they’d been without water and power in the high-rise building for multiple days.</p>



<p>Vie Towers told News4 the problem stems from the property’s electrical panel.</p>



<p>Residents say they’ve experienced low or no water pressure in their units, coupled with power outages that occurred since at least Friday.</p>



<p>With elevators not working, residents have been forced to climb stairwells some say are dark and dangerous.</p>



<p>Hyattsville said its code compliance team went to the property Tuesday morning after receiving several complaints in the building. They posted green signs on the property declaring the building “unfit for human habitation.” The signs order the property be vacated and remain that way until provisions of the order are complied with or the order has been withdrawn.</p>



<p>The city said it will fine the property $500 each day until the issues are fixed. The city said it cannot mandate residents leave the apartment, but the notice served to make residents aware of the situation.</p>



<p>“Vie Towers experienced significant damage to the building’s main electrical panel, impacting mechanical system,” the company said in a statement to News4.</p>



<p>Vie Towers said to expedite solutions, they are installing a temporary generator to restore power to the mechanical systems while they await “necessary parts for permanent repairs.” The building added they have already restored power to individual units.</p>



<p>Residents said students from the University of Maryland, Howard University and Prince George’s Community College live in the building.</p>



<p>“The most miserable thing is having to smell actual urine and feces in the hallways because some people are not able to flush their toilets. I think that’s very nasty, unhygienic and it’s just very unfit to live,” said Brooke, a senior at Howard.</p>

<p>The city said it will fine the property $500 each day until the issues are fixed. The city said it cannot mandate residents leave the apartment, but the notice served to make residents aware of the situation.</p>



<p>“Vie Towers experienced significant damage to the building’s main electrical panel, impacting mechanical system,” the company said in a statement to News4.</p>



<p>Vie Towers said to expedite solutions, they are installing a temporary generator to restore power to the mechanical systems while they await “necessary parts for permanent repairs.” The building added they have already restored power to individual units.</p>



<p>Residents said students from the University of Maryland, Howard University and Prince George’s Community College live in the building.</p>



<p>“The most miserable thing is having to smell actual urine and feces in the hallways because some people are not able to flush their toilets. I think that’s very nasty, unhygienic and it’s just very unfit to live,” said Brooke, a senior at Howard.</p>



<p>Howard told News4 it&#8217;s aware of the “challenges” at the building after a severe power outage Sunday. Building management is working to immediately restore services, to Howard&#8217;s knowledge.</p>



<p>Howard has a lease agreement with property management to provide residential space for 45 students, the university said, and its student affairs team has been in “continuous communication” with the property management company. The team was on site to coordinate support services for Howard students, including alternative housing if needed.</p>
