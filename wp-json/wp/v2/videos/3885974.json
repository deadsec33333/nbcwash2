Well, Miss Lake has different? Well, Miss Lake has probably been paying a tariff probably been paying a tariff all along, but she just did not all along, but she just did not realize. And here\u2019s the thing realize. And here\u2019s the thing tea and coffee prices are tea and coffee prices are expected to rise, and it\u2019s expected to rise, and it\u2019s really the retailers who choose really the retailers who choose if they choose to, who pays if they choose to, who pays basically. So they can either basically. So they can either absorb the cost themselves or absorb the cost themselves or pass it along to the consumer. pass it along to the consumer. France is part of the EU, which France is part of the EU, which is expecting a 20% reciprocal is expecting a 20% reciprocal tariff, as well as the 10% tariff, as well as the 10% across the board. So that next across the board. So that next sip of tea, unfortunately, Miss sip of tea, unfortunately, Miss Larkin is going to be a hard Larkin is going to be a hard pill to swallow.
