Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said an iPhone would <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2025\/04\/07\/apple-iphone-price-could-jump-350-in-us-on-trump-tariffs-analyst.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108128513\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cost $3,500<\/a> if produced in the country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the process of Apple moving its supply chain to the U.S. would take years, Martin said. Most supply chain experts say making iPhones completely in the U.S. is impossible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked by a reporter about iPhone production moving, Leavitt said Tuesday that Trump wants to bring manufacturing jobs to the U.S. She said he believes the U.S. has the workforce and resources to make the smartphone domestically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He believes we have the labor, we have the workforce, we have the resources to do it,&#8221; she said of Trump&#8217;s position on making iPhones in the U.S.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And, as you know, Apple has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2025\/02\/24\/apple-to-open-texas-ai-server-factory-in-500-billion-us-expansion.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108128513\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">invested $500 billion<\/a> here in the United States,&#8221; Leavitt added. &#8220;So, if Apple didn&#8217;t think the United States could do it, they probably wouldn&#8217;t have put up that big chunk of change.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Martin&#8217;s comments come as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2025\/04\/07\/apples-3-day-loss-in-market-cap-swells-to-almost-640-billion.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108128513\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">investors dump Apple shares<\/a> given its manufacturing exposure to China.
