MetroAccess works too, but it requires setting up rides days in advance and being willing to wait.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Transport DC program offers subsidized taxi rides, but only within the district.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to ride share companies like Uber and Lyft, the District does not require them to have wheelchair accessible vehicles \u2014 even though they account for 95% of all the for-hire rides here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That leaves taxis, which make up just 5% of all for-hire trips in D.C.&nbsp;Taxis are District regulated and provided 23,000 trips for people who use wheelchairs last year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I call it the Yeti, because it&#8217;s rumored to exist, but, you know, I rarely ever see it,&#8221; exclaimed a frustrated Mack while waiting on a taxi she had reserved days before we met up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The District has worked to increase service. D.C. has a law mandating 20% of large cab fleets be wheelchair accessible, but the I-Team couldn&#8217;t find it\u2019s ever been enforced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The head of the Department of For-Hire Vehicles (DFHV) told the I-Team, &#8220;we can\u2019t punish them into compliance.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Passenger Naomi Hess was hopeful last year when D.C. set aside $500,000 to incentivize cabdrivers to operate Wheelchair Accessible Vehicles -paying more per hour or to work late hours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere really, really needs to be progress,\u201d said Hess.&nbsp; The city even set up a&nbsp; Wheelchair Accessible Vehicle (WAV) hotline for people to get connected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI tried that pilot line multiple times and they just couldn&#8217;t find one for me. Where is the money going?\u201d asked Hess.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/04\/38900832537-1080pnbcstations.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1920&#038;resize=1920%2C1080\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10392069\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/04\/38900832537-1080pnbcstations.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1920&strip=all 1920w, https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/04\/38900832537-1080pnbcstations.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=218&strip=all 218w, https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/04\/38900832537-1080pnbcstations.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300&strip=all 300w, https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/04\/38900832537-1080pnbcstations.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=768&strip=all 768w, https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/04\/38900832537-1080pnbcstations.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1536&strip=all 1536w, https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/04\/38900832537-1080pnbcstations.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200&strip=all 1200w, https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/04\/38900832537-1080pnbcstations.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=850&strip=all 850w, https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/04\/38900832537-1080pnbcstations.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=600&strip=all 600w, https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/04\/38900832537-1080pnbcstations.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=500&strip=all 500w, https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/04\/38900832537-1080pnbcstations.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=400&strip=all 400w, https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/04\/38900832537-1080pnbcstations.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=320&strip=all 320w, https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/04\/38900832537-1080pnbcstations.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=200&strip=all 200w, https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/04\/38900832537-1080pnbcstations.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=100&strip=all 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The city already spent $255,000 in that pilot program and told the I-Team it generated 435 taxi trips from June to December. That&#8217;s $586 per ride.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonathan Rogers \u2014 the Director of DFHV, which spearheaded the pilot \u2014&nbsp;wouldn&#8217;t talk to News4 on camera, but said &#8220;Council encouraged us to experiment and figure out what would change behavior&#8230; so that&#8217;s what we did.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said he hoped it would build momentum, and that the six new drivers with accessible vehicles added, would stick with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The department just launched a new pilot program in March, and says it\u2019s offering more incentives to taxi companies and drivers. Plus, a spokesperson said it would be sending letters to all taxi companies asking for their long-term plans to address the issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAnyone without a wheelchair can get an Uber,&nbsp;Lyft or taxi, whatever they want. It&#8217;s just not fair. And it has put me in unsafe situations,&#8221; Hess told the I-Team.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last fall, she had all her travel planned out so she could attend the Sabrina Carpenter concert in Baltimore. But a delayed train back to D.C. got her to Union Station at 1 a.m., leaving her with few options. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I was forced to walk home alone in the middle of the night.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both she and Mack say&nbsp;it isn&#8217;t like this everywhere.&nbsp;In New York City, there are more than 12,000 wheelchair accessible taxis and ride share vehicles, according to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The city said 46% of its taxi fleet is wheelchair accessible.
