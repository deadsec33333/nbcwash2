his program into a powerhouse, with his team cultivating some of the most robust data on gay and trans Americans in history. Now, he\u2019s seen much of the institute topple in weeks and has been desperately seeking other positions for many of the half of his 120-person team who were supported by the grants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The NIH\u2019s new director, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, said in an emailed statement Wednesday that the agency remains \u201ccommitted to supporting research aimed at improving the health and well-being of every American\u201d but noted that it would be shifting its priorities \u201caway from politicized DEI and gender ideology studies\u201d in accordance with the president\u2019s executive orders.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

But the Trump administration\u2019s justification of NIH grant rejections based on what it perceives as the employment of DEI principles in academia has ensnared many research grants focused on gay populations as well.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This includes research into reducing rates of HIV and other STIs.

Last year, the study, which accrued almost 20 years of data from some participants, received a glowing assessment from the NIH.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The grant was canceled for ostensibly engaging in DEI, according to the termination letter, which Mustanski shared with NBC News.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s unclear how DEI is even defined,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big problem for scientists, because science is all about precision.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mustanski said his second grant supported implementing effective means of preventing and treating HIV as part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiv.gov\/federal-response\/ending-the-hiv-epidemic\/overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ending the HIV Epidemic<\/a>&nbsp;initiative that the first Trump administration launched.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s an incredible lack of transparency behind this process and who\u2019s behind it,\u201d Musanski said of the grant rejections. \u201cThat is not the condition that\u2019s going to produce the best science.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amid the prospect of both gay and trans people\u2019s erasure from the nation\u2019s research priorities, 30 editors of leading journals that focus on sex and gender research&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/00224499.2025.2474343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">published an editorial<\/a>&nbsp;last month in The Journal of Sex Research on this work\u2019s importance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cResearch into sexuality and gender is vital for identifying social, cultural, and medical needs of populations, and addressing inequalities across populations,\u201d they stated. \u201cAny limiting of research and forcing specific research agendas is an infringement on academic freedom and integrity.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, a clear chill has descended over many of the LGBTQ-focused researchers subjected to \u2014 or fearing \u2014 grant cancellations. NBC News reached out to more than 80 of them, but few responded and just seven were willing to speak on the record; the others said they were too scared of reprisals from the Trump administration.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMost of my colleagues are afraid to speak out, or they\u2019re being muzzled by their institutions,\u201d said Julia Marcus, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis is what authoritarianism looks like. Fear keeps people silent,\u201d said Marcus, who lost all her NIH grant funding for a trio of HIV and STI prevention studies, and shared the rejection letters with NBC News. With the hope for future grant opportunities appearing grim, she said, she faces the end of a 20-year career spent fighting HIV and promoting LGBTQ health.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any available private funding, from pharmaceutical companies, nonprofits and foundations, could not possibly rescue this overall field, she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A quarter-century effort<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Virtually all of the nation\u2019s LGBTQ-focused research apparatus has been built over the past quarter century.

Many such studies ignore, rather than seriously examine, biological realities. It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize these research programs.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers noted to NBC News that only a few of the canceled grants pertain to gender transition treatments for minors, which has become a political flashpoint.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even prominent right-wing critics of the agency\u2019s approach to research related to gender identity have taken issue with the Trump administration\u2019s tack of canceling grants.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/manhattan.institute\/person\/leor-sapir\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Leor Sapir<\/a>, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, has&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/manhattan.institute\/article\/reform-proposals-for-the-national-institutes-of-health-nih\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">advocated for NIH reforms<\/a>&nbsp;that align with Trump\u2019s orders on DEI and trans issues. However, he criticized the administration for its overly broad \u201csearch-term-based cancellation\u201d of NIH grants.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s quintessential bull in a china shop \u2014 Trumpesque,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cA much more fine-tuned approach needs to happen.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The prevailing question facing NIH-funded researchers is whether such a recalibration will occur now that Bhattacharya&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nih.gov\/news-events\/news-releases\/jay-bhattacharya-begins-tenure-18th-director-national-institutes-health\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">was sworn in as director Tuesday<\/a>. During his confirmation hearing early last month, Bhattacharya, a health economist formerly of Stanford, was&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rev.com\/transcripts\/dr-jayanta-bhattacharya-confirmation-hearing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">asked repeatedly<\/a>&nbsp;whether he would return the NIH to something resembling normal functioning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI will follow the laws,\u201d he said \u2014 a refrain he relied on for such questions. He added that he would \u201cmake sure\u201d that researchers within and funded by the NIH, \u201chave the resources they need to make sure that they do their research.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to questions about the grant cancellations \u2014 including one about the Trump administration\u2019s intentions regarding research specific to transgender people \u2014 Bhattacharya\u2019s statement Wednesday said the agency would be committed to research that improves the health of all Americans, \u201cregardless of their sexual identity,\u201d though it notably did not mention gender identity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It then noted that the agency would shift its priorities toward \u201cresearch aimed at preventing, treating, and curing chronic conditions like cancer, diabetes, heart disease, obesity and many others that cause so much suffering and deaths among all Americans, LGBTQ individuals included.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The statement made no specific mention of HIV, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/articles\/PMC4058441\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">chronic health condition<\/a>&nbsp;that disproportionately affects gay men and trans women. Also not mentioned was that at least 16 of the LGBTQ-focused grants that were terminated concerned cancer, diabetes or heart disease.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The hard work begins<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking toward an uncertain future, Northwestern\u2019s Mustanski, for one, said he hopes for success in appealing his grant rejections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Kenneth Mayer, medical director of Fenway Health, a leading LGBTQ-focused health center in Boston, expressed hope for \u201csome victories in the courts\u201d over the grant cancellations. Noting he was not speaking on behalf of his employer, he added: \u201cBut I am not in denial, so the field could collapse.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mayer and other LGBTQ-health researchers expressed concern that their field would lose a generation of academics focused on these populations \u2014 through layoffs, hiring freezes and the likelihood that bright young people would eschew a newly uncertain career in academia and public health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many veterans of this field reported suffering from what they characterize as foreboding d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu under the Trump regime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/globalhealth.duke.edu\/people\/beyrer-chris\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dr. Chris Beyrer<\/a>, director of the Duke Global Health Institute, said the past few weeks have reminded him of the horrors he witnessed in the 1980s.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhen I started my career in HIV research, there were really no dedicated funds\u201d for LGBTQ-specific research, he said. Recently, he added, he\u2019s been haunted by that period in his career, four decades ago, when he cared for babies dying of AIDS. This was a time when gay men&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/mmwr\/preview\/mmwrhtml\/mm5021a2.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">perished of the disease by the tens of thousands<\/a>&nbsp;while then-President Ronald Reagan remained largely, and notoriously, impassive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>UCLA\u2019s Meyer, however, struck an optimistic tone when he said that lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans Americans are nothing if not tenacious in the face of political adversity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOne thing that I tell students is LGBT people have been fighting for more than 100 years for our rights,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I think this just reminds us that we need to continue doing that.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This article first appeared on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/nbc-out\/out-news\/trump-administration-axes-125m-lgbtq-health-funding-upending-research-rcna199175\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NBCNews.com<\/a>.
