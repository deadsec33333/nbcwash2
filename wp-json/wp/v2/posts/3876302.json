It was 46 years old at the time of the collision, according to the university.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are now out with a list of 20 other bridges they say are most vulnerable to these strikes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-nbc-section-heading\">Despite a warning, officials say they have \u2018no regulatory obligation to modify or upgrade\u2019 the Chesapeake Bay Bridge<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the D.C. area, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge made the list, with Shields\u2019 team suggesting a significant collision could occur there once every 86 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That makes it less vulnerable than those on top of the list, which include the Huey P. Long Bridge outside New Orleans, where researchers expect a collision once every 17 years, and the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, which researchers said could expect a collision every 22 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cUnless changes are made, I don&#8217;t see the risk going down, unless somehow ships get smaller and traffic gets less,\u201d Shields told the I-Team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked about Maryland\u2019s Chesapeake Bay Bridge, Shields said he\u2019d like to see collision avoidance and pier protection systems added to the existing bridge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a very serious need to look at protections for bridges like the Bay Bridge,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to those concerns, the Maryland Department of Transportation told the I-Team it \u201chas no regulatory obligation to modify or upgrade it,\u201d but because of the Dali incident, \u201cthe MDTA is working with outside bridge experts to evaluate the pier protection systems and vessel transit procedures for both the new Key Bridge and the existing Bay Bridge.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The state added that if upgrades are needed, they will be \u201cprioritized as appropriate.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"recirc-module\">\n\t\t\t<h3 class=\"recirc__heading\"><\/h3>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"recirc__subheading\"><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div

a researcher flagged concerns about Baltimore&#8217;s planned Key Bridge replacement<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Shields said he\u2019s also concerned about the early renderings of the new Key Bridge, which has yet to be built. He said he would prefer it give ships even more space to maneuver than in the current redesign.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I was a little disappointed that the span isn&#8217;t longer than it is,\u201d Shields said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The span under the old Key Bridge was 1,209 feet long, records show. The Maryland Transportation Authority told the I -Team the new Key Bridge will have a main span of 1,600 feet, 35% wider than before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shields suggested a main span of 2,000 feet. A longer span, he said, gives ships more room to correct mistakes and still avoid a collision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MDTA called it \u201cpremature\u201d to make assumptions at this point in the design, which has many more safety features yet to be revealed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response, the MDTA told the I-Team, \u201cIt would be premature and inaccurate to make assumptions about the Key Bridge Rebuild when only 15% of the design has been released.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the deadly Sunshine Skyway Bridge collision near Tampa in 1980, it took 14 years to finalize new bridge design standards. Every bridge built after that is designed to ideally avoid ship collisions, but those new standards did little to protect bridges that were already standing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the wake of the Dali crash, some questioned whether anything could be done to protect aging bridges from a direct ship collision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It was going to be difficult for any infrastructure to be able to take on that that blunt level of impact,\u201d Maryland Gov. Wes Moore told the Today Show following the collision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-nbc-section-heading\">Why the NTSB head criticized Maryland transportation officials<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>More recently, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board, Jennifer Homendy, criticized Maryland for not doing the work that she said might have prevented the tragedy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHad the MDTA conducted a vulnerability assessment of the Key Bridge based on recent vessel traffic, the MDTA would have been able to proactively identify strategies to reduce the risk of a collapse and loss of lives associated with vessel collision with the bridge,\u201d Homendy said at a press conference last week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to those findings, the MDTA said it maintains the Key Bridge catastrophe &#8220;was the sole fault of the Dali and the gross negligence of [its] owners.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s more, the NTSB listed the Bay Bridge as among 68 they said have \u201cunknown levels of risk of collapse from a vessel collision.&#8221; Fourteen of the bridges Shields\u2019 team identified as most vulnerable also appeared on the NTSB\u2019s list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/03\/68-bridges.png?resize=854%2C480&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10352725\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/03\/68-bridges.png?w=854&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 854w, https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/03\/68-bridges.png?w=218&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 218w, https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/03\/68-bridges.png?w=300&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 300w, https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/03\/68-bridges.png?w=768&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 768w, https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/03\/68-bridges.png?w=1200&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 1200w, https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/03\/68-bridges.png?w=850&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 850w, https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/03\/68-bridges.png?w=600&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 600w, https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/03\/68-bridges.png?w=500&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 500w, https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/03\/68-bridges.png?w=400&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 400w, https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/03\/68-bridges.png?w=320&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 320w, https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/03\/68-bridges.png?w=200&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 200w, https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/03\/68-bridges.png?w=100&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 100w, https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/03\/68-bridges.png?w=1920&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Shields agreed a boat that big hitting virtually any bridge would cause severe damage and said the key to avoiding another Key Bridge catastrophe is by protecting the bridge from ships to begin with, through concrete blockades and building bridge supports on islands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There are immediate investments that we can make,\u201d Shields told the I-Team. \u201cThe investments, while not cheap, are much, much lower than the investments would be in the event of an accident.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The nation\u2019s most vulnerable bridges at risk of collision, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers, are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1055\" height=\"586\" src=\"https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/03\/z-long-bridge.png?resize=1055%2C586&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10354390\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/03\/z-long-bridge.png?w=1055&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 1055w, https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/03\/z-long-bridge.png?w=300&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 300w, https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/03\/z-long-bridge.png?w=768&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 768w, https:\/\/media.nbcwashington.com\/2025\/03\/z-long-bridge.png?w=100&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Huey P.
