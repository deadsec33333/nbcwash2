She was originally booked to lead training courses through August. Now, she said, her calendar is empty and tens of thousands of dollars she expected in income are gone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI felt like I was right on the cusp,\u201d said Antoine, who entered the contracting field only a few years ago and hoped to turn a profit this year for the first time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, she isn\u2019t sure her business will survive and is worried about what that means for her household.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSome of our leaders may think that they&#8217;re disrupting how the government has functioned, but they&#8217;re disrupting homes, and they&#8217;re disrupting families,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Antoine said her trainings didn\u2019t fall under diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives the president has eliminated. Still, like other contractors who gathered at the Northern Virginia Black Chamber of Commerce, she said she feels especially vulnerable now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI think it&#8217;s hitting communities of color and small businesses, women minority-owned businesses, because it takes us so much longer to get these contracts,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Samuel Wiggins, president of the Virginia Minority Chambers, a nonprofit that serves and advocates for minority chambers of commerce across the commonwealth, called federal contracts the \u201choly grail\u201d for many contractors of color.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEvery contractor, every federal contractor &#8212; their whole goal is to get that first government contract,\u201d he said, explaining once a contractor develops relationships and a solid reputation, it can \u201clead to a whole lifetime of your business having government contracts.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the numbers show just how hard getting contracts can be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the U.S. Department of Labor, in 2021 minority-owned businesses represented 24% of eligible businesses for federal contract awards but were only awarded 3%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Black business owners in particular accounted for nearly 12% of eligible contract recipients but were awarded fewer than 5%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under President Joe Biden, the Small Business Administration worked to increase the number of federal contract dollars awarded to small, disadvantaged businesses from 5% annually to as high as 15% by 2025.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But after Trump took office, the SBA rescinded Biden\u2019s executive orders dealing with diversity, equity and inclusion, a move that reset the contracting goal to 5%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wiggins said his members are concerned about those changes and whether the so-called set aside programs through the SBA will become targets as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThat does bring associated fear. It does feel like they&#8217;re being abandoned or even targeted,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attorney Kendra Perkins Norwood, a federal procurement attorney who represents both large and small government contractors, said federal contracts have been critical to the Black community in the D.C. region and beyond.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFederal government contracting has been responsible for wealth generation in many communities, particularly the Black community. It has created the Black middle class, in many instances,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She argued there\u2019s still a need for programs to help disadvantaged business owners get a seat at the federal contracting table.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe know that minority-owned businesses don&#8217;t necessarily perform financially as well as majority-owned businesses. And so, until we see that sort of equity across the board, I would say that programs like this do need to continue,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wiggins said while the path seems more challenging than ever, he encourages business owners to stay the course and pivot as necessary.<\/p>\n\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"recirc-module\">\n\t\t\t<h3 class=\"recirc__heading\"><\/h3>\n\t\t\t<p
