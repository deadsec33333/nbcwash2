His own aides had quietly raised alarms about the financial markets before he<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>temporarily suspended a tariff regime that he had unveiled with a flourish just one week earlier in a Rose Garden ceremony.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/politics\/trump-administration\/live-blog\/trump-administration-live-updates-global-tariffs-china-rcna200346\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong><em>Follow live politics coverage here<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stock market rose immediately after the about-face, ending days of losses that have forced older Americans who&#8217;ve been sinking their savings into 401(k)s to rethink their retirement plans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahead of Trump&#8217;s announcement, some of his advisers had been in a near panic about the bond markets, according to a senior administration official. Interest rates on 10-year Treasury bonds had been rising, contrary to what normally happens when stock prices fall and investors seek safety in treasuries. That unusual dynamic meant that at the same time the tariffs could push up prices, people would be paying more to buy a home or pay off credit card debt due to higher interest rates. Business looking to expand would pay more for a new loan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two of Trump&#8217;s most senior advisers, <a href=\"\/news\/national-international\/5-things-to-know-about-scott-bessent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent<\/a> and <a href=\"\/news\/national-international\/5-things-to-know-about-howard-lutnick\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick<\/a>, presented a united front on Wednesday, urging the president to suspend the tariffs in light of the bond market, the administration official said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/howardlutnick\/status\/1910022477373227166\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">In a social media post<\/a>, Trump announced a 90-day pause that he said he\u2019ll use to negotiate deals with dozens of countries that have expressed openness to revising trade terms that he contends exploit American businesses and workers. One exception is China. Trump upped the tariff on the nation\u2019s biggest geopolitical rival to 125%, part of a tit-for-tat escalation in an evolving trade war.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump\u2019s reversal came one week after an appearance in the Rose Garden where he unveiled his plan to bring jobs back to the U.S. Displaying a chart showing the new, elevated tariffs that countries would face, Trump proclaimed, \u201cMy fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n<div data-react-component='VideoPlaylist' data-props='{&quot;accountId&quot;:&quot;Yh1nAC&quot;,&quot;autoplay&quot;:false,&quot;placeholder&quot;:true,&quot;brand&quot;:&quot;nbc&quot;,&quot;host&quot;:&quot;nbcwashington.com&quot;,&quot;twitter&quot;:&quot;nbcwashington&quot;,&quot;callLetters&quot;:&quot;WRC&quot;,&quot;station&quot;:&quot;NBC4 WASHINGTON&quot;,&quot;excludeEndCard&quot;:false,&quot;islead&quot;:false,&quot;fastSchedule&quot;:[],&quot;videos&quot;:[{&quot;mediaId&quot;:&quot;Sk_WTnijB_su&quot;,&quot;poster&quot;:&quot;https:\\\/\\\/media.nbcmiami.com\\\/2025\\\/04\\\/38754303233-1080pnbcstations.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;resize=850%2C478&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Trump announces new tariffs, including 25% on all foreign made automobiles&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https:\\\/\\\/www.nbcwashington.com\\\/news\\\/national-international\\\/donald-trump-tariffs-automobiles-foreign\\\/3882111\\\/&quot;,&quot;videoContentId&quot;:&quot;1:1:10372710&quot;,&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;2418722371853&quot;,&quot;isLivestream&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;isFast&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;m3uPid&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;mp4Url&quot;:&quot;https:\\\/\\\/prodamdlim.akamaized.net\\\/NBCU_LM_VMS\\\/626\\\/415\\\/38754303233-1080pnbcnews6m.mp4&quot;,&quot;m3u8Url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;catNames&quot;:{&quot;223863&quot;:&quot;News&quot;,&quot;619&quot;:&quot;U.S. &amp;amp; World&quot;},&quot;tagNames&quot;:{&quot;282&quot;:&quot;Donald Trump&quot;},&quot;contentSource&quot;:&quot;NBC&quot;,&quot;sentiment&quot;:&quot;Neutral&quot;,&quot;topic&quot;:&quot;Politics&quot;,&quot;origination&quot;:&quot;NBCU LM VMS&quot;,&quot;sponsorName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;datePublished&quot;:&quot;2025-04-02T16:59:22&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:73,&quot;syndicated_id&quot;:&quot;1:1:10372710&quot;,&quot;videoSport&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;videoLeague&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;videoTeam&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;show&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;event&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;genre&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;originCallLetters&quot;:&quot;NATIONALNBC&quot;,&quot;canonicalUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\\\/\\\/www.nbcphiladelphia.com\\\/news\\\/national-international\\\/donald-trump-tariffs-automobiles-foreign\\\/4150082\\\/&quot;,&quot;sensitivity&quot;:[],&quot;disableEmbed&quot;:false}]}'><\/div>\n\n\n<p>It proved short-lived.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Markets plunged in anticipation of heightened trade wars, wiping out trillions of dollars in wealth. Democrats seized on the issue, looking to undercut a source of Trump\u2019s popular appeal: the view that he can be trusted to steer the nation\u2019s economy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s market crash has vaporized a whopping $104,000 from the average retirement account,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Wednesday in a speech on the Senate floor, hours before Trump\u2019s reversal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The episode laid bare the rifts within Trump\u2019s team of senior advisers as the White House struggled to offer a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/politics\/donald-trump\/trump-holds-firm-tariffs-white-house-looks-ways-calm-nervous-allies-rcna199940\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">clear, consistent argument<\/a>&nbsp;about the duration of the tariffs. While Bessent seemed open to negotiations, <a href=\"\/news\/national-international\/5-things-to-know-about-peter-navarro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Peter Navarro, a senior trade adviser<\/a>, appeared to take a more hardline posture.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"\/tag\/elon-musk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Elon Musk<\/a>, the billionaire Tesla CEO who has been advising Trump on the government workforce,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/politics\/economics\/elon-musk-calls-trumps-top-trade-adviser-peter-navarro-moron-dumber-sa-rcna200208\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">called Navarro<\/a>&nbsp;\u201cdumber than a sack of bricks,\u201d while Navarro described Musk as someone who is merely \u201ca car assembler, in many cases.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the week-long drama also underscored the peril of a policy-making process that is often tied to the wishes and vagaries of one man: Trump.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asked about the dustup between Musk and Navarro, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a golf partner of the president, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it matters. The only one who matters is Trump.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Markets tend to favor predictability, as do business leaders deciding where to build new plants. When Trump sets a course, however, there are bound to be detours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One friend of his who spoke to him in recent days said that Trump gave no sign he was about to \u201cback down quickly on this stuff.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump believes that other countries trade unfairly and sees tariffs as a tool to make the U.S. more competitive, the person said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s

Wednesday\u2019s announcement, Trump and his aides were also hearing from GOP lawmakers and outside allies urging an alternate path.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One was Larry Kudlow, who hosts a show on Fox Business Network and was a senior economic adviser in Trump\u2019s first term.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kudlow told NBC News that he has had \u201congoing\u201d talks with friends inside the West Wing about the need to negotiate with other countries before slapping them with tariffs that stand in perpetuity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Describing Trump\u2019s move Wednesday as \u201cfabulous,\u201d Kudlow added: \u201cDealmaking is the best thing to do. In the last 48 hours, Trump has gone from non-negotiating to negotiating. It\u2019s very clear that Bessent is now the point man on trade. Very clear.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anxious GOP lawmakers also weighed in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Graham said he spoke to Trump at length Tuesday night and told him he\u2019s been hearing from car manufacturers who are worried about how the tariffs would affect their business. BMW operates a plant in Graham\u2019s home state and is one of the companies the senator said he has spoken to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., was also a lawmaker in touch with the administration, saying on Tuesday that he planned to have lunch with Bessent. On Wednesday, he told NBC News he was also talking to the White House. Kennedy likened Trump to the \u201cpitbull who caught the car.\u201d Now, he said, the question becomes: \u201cWhat are you going to do with the car?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After more market losses this week, and with pressure mounting from Republicans on Capitol Hill, Trump began having second thoughts.
