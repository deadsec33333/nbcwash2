The tech-heavy Nasdaq index saw its biggest one-day gain since 2008, rising nearly 12%; while the S&amp;P 500 climbed 9.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 8% or about 2,800 points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump could have been generally urging people to buy into the market while prices were relatively low. That was the response <a href=\"\/news\/national-international\/5-things-to-know-about-howard-lutnick\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick<\/a> gave when asked about the posts Wednesday evening on CNBC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDonald Trump understands that \u2026 America is the greatest country, all right?
