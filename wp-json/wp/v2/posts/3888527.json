Wallace included a photo of Ellis, and the post went viral, the lawsuit states.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wallace deleted that original post, according to the lawsuit, and then shared two others linking Ellis to the crash. One referred to an interview that Ellis did with&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/the-smerconish-podcast.simplecast.com\/episodes\/she-has-served-15-years-in-the-military-and-wants-to-serve-more-a-transgender-service-members-perspective\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Smerconish Podcast<\/a>, in which she said President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/nbc-out\/out-politics-and-policy\/trump-executive-order-transgender-military-dei-rcna189470\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">barring trans people from serving and enlisting<\/a>&nbsp;in the military made her nervous.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second post included photos of Ellis and said she might have participated in \u201canother trans terror attack,\u201d according to the lawsuit. That post received 4.8 million views on X, the suit states.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wallace did not immediately return a request for comment regarding the allegations in the lawsuit.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Jan. 31, after Ellis learned about the rumors, she&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/nbc-out\/out-news\/jo-ellis-dc-plane-crash-rumors-helicopter-pilot-transgender-trump-dei-rcna190180\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">shared a \u201cproof of life\u201d video on Facebook<\/a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI understand some people have associated me with the crash in D.C., and that is false,\u201d Ellis said in the Facebook video. \u201cIt is insulting to the families to try to tie this to some sort of political agenda.

And I hope that you all know that I am alive and well, and this should be sufficient for you all to end all the rumors.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon after Ellis\u2019 statement on Facebook, Wallace shared another X user\u2019s post with Ellis\u2019 video, writing that it was an \u201cImportant Update!\u201d and adding that Ellis was not piloting the helicopter and is still alive. Wallace also wrote in another X post that the original rumor that Ellis had been flying the helicopter involved in the crash came from another account with the handle @FakeGayPolitics, which is&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/FakeGayPolitics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">no longer active<\/a>. Wallace said the rumor \u201cseemed credible\u201d because Ellis, whom Wallace misgendered in his posts, \u201cwrote an article calling out Trump\u2019s trans military ban only a few days ago.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellis was not involved in the midair collision, the lawsuit states, did not write an article \u201ccalling out\u201d Trump\u2019s trans military ban and did not engage in \u201canother trans terror attack.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Equality Legal Action Fund, an LGBTQ legal organization representing Ellis, argues in the complaint that Wallace \u201cconcocted a destructive and irresponsible defamation campaign\u201d against Ellis.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe damage caused to Plaintiff by Defendant was instantaneous and immense,\u201d the lawsuit continues. \u201cPrior to Defendant\u2019s campaign, Plaintiff was a private citizen who led a private life away from social media and the limelight.
