Without the ability to work remotely or money to pay for afterschool child care, she didn\u2019t see any way to keep her job and also care for her child.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When she received the now-infamous Fork in the Road email from Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, pressuring federal workers to resign or risk being laid off, she decided taking the deferred resignation was her best option. She said she didn\u2019t want to pull her son out of his school and move closer to D.C. amid threatened layoffs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want this.

So, women just dropping out altogether because they can&#8217;t manage caregiving responsibilities alongside their jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cOr we&#8217;ll see women making really constrained choices when they do work, so, taking a job that&#8217;s maybe suboptimal for them, they don&#8217;t like as much, they don&#8217;t earn as much, but they just don&#8217;t have another choice because it&#8217;s the only thing that works with their caregiving responsibilities.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Six in 10 women surveyed by Bahn\u2019s group said job flexibility determines whether they\u2019ll accept a job offer.
