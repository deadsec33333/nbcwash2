King Charles, then Prince of Wales, also met Pope Francis during the 2019 canonization of St. John Henry Newman. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pope has been convalescing at the Vatican since March 23 and made an appearance to the faithful in St. Peter\u2019s Square on Sunday. He was pushed in a wheelchair, wearing nasal tubes for supplemental oxygen, and wished the crowd a good Sunday from the front of the altar before being greeted by participants in the Mass, some of whom leaned to kiss his hands. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-nbc-section-heading\">Charles addresses Parliament<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Charles stressed the need for close ties between Italy and the UK in a historic speech in the Italian parliament, calling for unity in defense of common values at a time of war in Europe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charles, the first British monarch and fourth foreign leader to address a joint session of the Italian parliament, highlighted the long history between the U.K. and Italy and their shared culture, going back to the ancient Romans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur younger generations can see in the news every day on their smartphones and tablets that peace is never to be taken for granted,\u201d Charles said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The British king was on the third day of his visit to Italy, seen as part of an ongoing effort by London to strengthen ties with its European allies amid global turbulence and rising instability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur countries have both stood by Ukraine in her hour of need and welcomed many thousands of Ukrainians requiring shelter,\u201d he said in his speech, warning that images of wars were now reverberating again across the continent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charles added that Italian and British armed forces \u201cstand side by side\u201d as part of the NATO alliance, noting the two countries\u2019 joint plans to develop with Japan a new fighter jet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt will generate thousands of jobs in our countries and speaks volumes about the trust we place in each other,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the Italian trip, King Charles and Queen Camilla also marked their 20th wedding anniversary, which was to include a state dinner later Wednesday hosted by President Sergio Mattarella at the Quirinale palace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The queen marked her anniversary by wearing her wedding dress, which had been modified by its designer Anne Valentine, with additional embroidery by King\u2019s Foundation artisan Beth Somerville. The garment was originally worn for the civil ceremony, when Camilla paired the outfit with a hat made of natural straw, overlaid with ivory French lace designed by Philip Treacy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On her wedding day, Camilla later wore a separate chiffon dress embroidered pale blue and gold coat for the wedding blessing at St George\u2019s Chapel, Windsor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Charles met Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni at Rome\u2019s Villa Doria Pamphili, enjoying a walk in the 17th Century palace\u2019s gardens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a few weeks, he will mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe together with Mattarella.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-nbc-section-heading\">Climate change warnings<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Charles also spoke passionately in his address about threats facing the planet, recalling another speech he gave in Italy 16 years ago and how the \u201cwarnings\u201d he made at the time about the urgency of the climate challenge were \u201cdepressingly being borne out by events.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He noted extreme storms \u201cnormally seen once in a generation\u201d are now an issue every year, and \u201ccountless precious plant and animal species face extinction in our lifetimes\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sections of the speech were delivered in Italian, with the King prompting the applause of Italian lawmakers when he noted: \u201cAnd by the way, I hope I\u2019m not ruining Dante\u2019s language so much that I\u2019m no never invited to Italy again.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charles was on his first trip abroad this year after being taken to hospital over side effects related to his ongoing cancer treatment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>___<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Kirka reported from London.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Pope Francis met privately with King Charles III and Queen Camilla at the Vatican during the royal couple\u2019s four-day state visit to Italy.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3230,"featured_media":10392740,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"apple_news_api_created_at":"","apple_news_api_id":"","apple_news_api_modified_at":"","apple_news_api_revision":"","apple_news_api_share_url":"","apple_news_coverimage":0,"apple_news_coverimage_caption":"","apple_news_is_hidden":false,"apple_news_is_paid":false,"apple_news_is_preview":false,"apple_news_is_sponsored":false,"apple_news_maturity_rating":"","apple_news_metadata":"\"\"","apple_news_pullquote":"","apple_news_pullquote_position":"","apple_news_slug":"","apple_news_sections":"\"\"","apple_news_suppress_video_url":false,"apple_news_use_image_component":false,"syndicated_id":"1:1:10390521","should_nationalize":false,"nbc_subtitle":"The mid-afternoon visit lasted about 20 minutes and included a private exchange of gifts.","nbc_first_published_date":"April 9, 2025","nbc_prevent_modified_update":false,"nbc_linkout_title":"","nbc_linkout_url":"","nbc_linkout_excerpt_link":"","nbc_primary_category_id":190,"nbc_primary_tag_id":1169,"nbc_alexa_brief":"","nbc_social_page_title":"","nbc_social_description":"","nbc_page_title":"Pope Francis meets privately with King Charles and Queen Camilla","nbc_seo_description":"Pope Francis met privately with King Charles III and Queen Camilla on Wednesday.","nbc_national_headline":"","entities":"","lede_video_id":"1:1:10347998","lead_embed_url":"","featured_media_caption":"","nbc_canonical_market":"9","nbc_canonical_url":"","nbc_hide_from_recirculation":"","nbc_hide_from_search":"","dark_mode":"","title_below":"","disable_copyright":"","copyright_override":"","nbc_syndication_category":"1:1:190","nbc_syndication_category_name":"U.S. &amp;
