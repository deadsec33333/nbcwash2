The city frustrating and unfair. The city just restarted a pilot program just restarted a pilot program aimed at helping the I-Team aimed at helping the I-Team tracked the city\u2019s first efforts tracked the city\u2019s first efforts in that program, and found out in that program, and found out it cost DC Taxpayers more than it cost DC Taxpayers more than 600.

Ted Oberg and the I-Team went Ted Oberg and the I-Team went looking for answers. It says looking for answers. It says assigning driver on the assigning driver on the afternoon we caught up with afternoon we caught up with Kelly Mack. She just needed a Kelly Mack. She just needed a ride to the grocery store.

Max used a wheelchair since she was ten, wheelchair since she was ten, moved to DC after college, she moved to DC after college, she tells us, because our city was tells us, because our city was trying to be more accessible. trying to be more accessible. Are they keeping the promise? So Are they keeping the promise? So here and there? It\u2019s not exactly here and there? It\u2019s not exactly the city\u2019s motto. It\u2019s hard. DC the city\u2019s motto. It\u2019s hard. DC Has a few options for passengers Has a few options for passengers with wheelchairs. Metro is with wheelchairs. Metro is accessible. Metro access works, accessible. Metro access works, too, but requires setting up too, but requires setting up rides days in advance and being rides days in advance and being willing to wait. The transport willing to wait. The transport DC Program offers subsidized DC Program offers subsidized taxi rides, but only within the taxi rides, but only within the district. The district doesn\u2019t district. The district doesn\u2019t require rideshare companies like require rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft to have wheelchair Uber and Lyft to have wheelchair accessible vehicles, and they accessible vehicles, and they account for 95% of all the for account for 95% of all the for hire rides here, which leaves hire rides here, which leaves taxis. They make up just 5% of taxis. They make up just 5% of all the for hire trips in DC Did all the for hire trips in DC Did they have someone? They didn\u2019t they have someone? They didn\u2019t have anyone yet. Taxis are have anyone yet. Taxis are district regulated and provided district regulated and provided 23,000 trips for people who use 23,000 trips for people who use wheelchairs last year. Riders wheelchairs last year. Riders like Kelly tell us wheelchair like Kelly tell us wheelchair accessible taxis are not exactly accessible taxis are not exactly plentiful when you need one. I plentiful when you need one. I call it the Yeti because it\u2019s call it the Yeti because it\u2019s rumored to exist, but you know, rumored to exist, but you know, I rarely ever see it. Which is I rarely ever see it. Which is why the district, with every why the district, with every good intention, has tried to good intention, has tried to increase service. DC Has a law increase service. DC Has a law mandating 20% of large cab mandating 20% of large cab fleets have to be wheelchair fleets have to be wheelchair accessible, but the I-Team accessible, but the I-Team couldn\u2019t find that it\u2019s ever couldn\u2019t find that it\u2019s ever been enforced. And the head of been enforced. And the head of the department with oversight the department with oversight told us we can\u2019t punish them told us we can\u2019t punish them into compliance. There really, into compliance. There really, really needs to be progress. really needs to be progress. Naomi Hesse was hopeful last Naomi Hesse was hopeful last year when DC Set aside 500,000 year when DC Set aside 500,000 more of your dollars to more of your dollars to incentivize cab drivers to incentivize cab drivers to operate wheelchair accessible operate wheelchair accessible vehicles, paying those drivers vehicles, paying those drivers more per hour or to work late more per hour or to work late hours. The city even set up a hours. The city even set up a hotline for people to get hotline for people to get connected. I tried that pilot connected. I tried that pilot line multiple times and they line multiple times and they just couldn\u2019t find one for me. just couldn\u2019t find one for me. Where is the money going? The Where is the money going? The district spent $255,000 in that district spent $255,000 in that pilot program, which generated pilot program, which generated 435 wheelchair taxi trips over 435 wheelchair taxi trips over six months. That\u2019s $586.21 per six months. That\u2019s $586.21 per ride. Not exactly a return on ride. Not exactly a return on investment to brag about. investment to brag about. Jonathan Rogers, the director of Jonathan Rogers, the director of DC\u2019s Department of for hire DC\u2019s Department of for hire vehicles, which spearheaded the vehicles, which spearheaded the pilot, wouldn\u2019t talk to us on pilot, wouldn\u2019t talk to us on camera, but he told the I-Team camera, but he told the I-Team Council, encouraged us to Council, encouraged us to experiment and figure out what experiment and figure out what would change behavior. So that\u2019s would change behavior. So that\u2019s what we did. He said he hoped it what we did. He said he hoped it would build momentum and that would build momentum and that the six new drivers added to the the six new drivers added to the program would stick with it. program would stick with it. Anyone without a wheelchair can Anyone without a wheelchair can get an Uber, Lyft or taxi get an Uber, Lyft or taxi whenever they want. It\u2019s just whenever they want. It\u2019s just not fair. Last fall, Naomi Hesse not fair. Last fall, Naomi Hesse had all her travel planned out had all her travel planned out so she could attend the Sabrina so she could attend the Sabrina Carpenter concert in Baltimore, Carpenter concert in Baltimore, but a delayed Amtrak train got but a delayed Amtrak train got her to Union Station at one in her to Union Station at one in the morning, leaving her with the morning, leaving her with few options. I was forced to few options. I was forced to walk home alone in the middle of walk home alone in the middle of the night. She says. It isn\u2019t the night. She says. It isn\u2019t like this everywhere in New York like this everywhere in New York City, there are more than 12,000 City, there are more than 12,000 wheelchair accessible taxis and wheelchair accessible taxis and rideshare vehicles. That city rideshare vehicles. That city says 46% of their taxi fleet is says 46% of their taxi fleet is wheelchair accessible. And by wheelchair accessible. And by law, anyone who now wants to law, anyone who now wants to start driving for a rideshare start driving for a rideshare company there must use an company there must use an accessible vehicle. Here in D.C, accessible vehicle. Here in D.C, Uber has a few, but didn\u2019t Uber has a few, but didn\u2019t respond to any of our questions respond to any of our questions about wheelchair vehicles. Lyft about wheelchair vehicles. Lyft has none in D.C, but does offer has none in D.C, but does offer them in nine other cities. They them in nine other cities. They told the I-Team it will continue told the I-Team it will continue to push for solutions that make to push for solutions that make rideshare as accessible as rideshare as accessible as possible for everyone. This one possible for everyone. This one needs a transmission. This one needs a transmission. This one needs a transmission. As for needs a transmission. As for taxis, none of the larger taxis, none of the larger companies in town would talk to companies in town would talk to us on camera, but did admit it us on camera, but did admit it is a challenge saying wheelchair is a challenge saying wheelchair accessible taxis are both accessible taxis are both expensive to buy and costly to expensive to buy and costly to maintain due mostly to their maintain due mostly to their weight and modifications, which weight and modifications, which could explain why we found so could explain why we found so many in their lots. Do you have many in their lots. Do you have an estimated time for riders an estimated time for riders like Kelly Mack, who just wants like Kelly Mack, who just wants to get to the store? It all to get to the store? It all feels pretty isolating. I had 72 feels pretty isolating. I had 72 attempted trips. So frustrating. attempted trips. So frustrating. She started tracking every taxi She started tracking every taxi call she made for the last three call she made for the last three years. 71% failure rate, which years. 71% failure rate, which is exactly what happened on the is exactly what happened on the day we spent with her.

She is upbeat, coat, head out. She is upbeat, but it was so frustrating to but it was so frustrating to watch, knowing almost three watch, knowing almost three quarters of the time this quarters of the time this doesn\u2019t work for her. DC\u2019s doesn\u2019t work for her. DC\u2019s Department of For-hire vehicles Department of For-hire vehicles told us it is offering more told us it is offering more incentives in a new version of incentives in a new version of the pilot program, launched just the pilot program, launched just a short time ago, and they\u2019ll be a short time ago, and they\u2019ll be sending letters to all taxi sending letters to all taxi companies asking for their long companies asking for their long term plans to address this term plans to address this shortage.

The city frustrating and unfair. The city just restarted a pilot program just restarted a pilot program aimed at helping the I-Team aimed at helping the I-Team tracked the city\u2019s first efforts tracked the city\u2019s first efforts in that program, and found out in that program, and found out it cost DC Taxpayers more than it cost DC Taxpayers more than 600.

It says assigning driver on the assigning driver on the afternoon we caught up with afternoon we caught up with Kelly Mack. She just needed a Kelly Mack. She just needed a ride to the grocery store.

Max used a wheelchair since she was ten, wheelchair since she was ten, moved to DC after college, she moved to DC after college, she tells us, because our city was tells us, because our city was trying to be more accessible. trying to be more accessible. Are they keeping the promise? So Are they keeping the promise? So here and there? It\u2019s not exactly here and there? It\u2019s not exactly the city\u2019s motto. It\u2019s hard. DC the city\u2019s motto. It\u2019s hard. DC Has a few options for passengers Has a few options for passengers with wheelchairs. Metro is with wheelchairs. Metro is accessible. Metro access works, accessible. Metro access works, too, but requires setting up too, but requires setting up rides days in advance and being rides days in advance and being willing to wait. The transport willing to wait. The transport DC Program offers subsidized DC Program offers subsidized taxi rides, but only within the taxi rides, but only within the district. The district doesn\u2019t district. The district doesn\u2019t require rideshare companies like require rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft to have wheelchair Uber and Lyft to have wheelchair accessible vehicles, and they accessible vehicles, and they account for 95% of all the for account for 95% of all the for hire rides here, which leaves hire rides here, which leaves taxis. They make up just 5% of taxis. They make up just 5% of all the for hire trips in DC Did all the for hire trips in DC Did they have someone? They didn\u2019t they have someone? They didn\u2019t have anyone yet. Taxis are have anyone yet. Taxis are district regulated and provided district regulated and provided 23,000 trips for people who use 23,000 trips for people who use wheelchairs last year. Riders wheelchairs last year. Riders like Kelly tell us wheelchair like Kelly tell us wheelchair accessible taxis are not exactly accessible taxis are not exactly plentiful when you need one. I plentiful when you need one. I call it the Yeti because it\u2019s call it the Yeti because it\u2019s rumored to exist, but you know, rumored to exist, but you know, I rarely ever see it. Which is I rarely ever see it. Which is why the district, with every why the district, with every good intention, has tried to good intention, has tried to increase service. DC Has a law increase service. DC Has a law mandating 20% of large cab mandating 20% of large cab fleets have to be wheelchair fleets have to be wheelchair accessible, but the I-Team accessible, but the I-Team couldn\u2019t find that it\u2019s ever couldn\u2019t find that it\u2019s ever been enforced. And the head of been enforced. And the head of the department with oversight the department with oversight told us we can\u2019t punish them told us we can\u2019t punish them into compliance. There really, into compliance. There really, really needs to be progress. really needs to be progress. Naomi Hesse was hopeful last Naomi Hesse was hopeful last year when DC Set aside 500,000 year when DC Set aside 500,000 more of your dollars to more of your dollars to incentivize cab drivers to incentivize cab drivers to operate wheelchair accessible operate wheelchair accessible vehicles, paying those drivers vehicles, paying those drivers more per hour or to work late more per hour or to work late hours. The city even set up a hours. The city even set up a hotline for people to get hotline for people to get connected. I tried that pilot connected. I tried that pilot line multiple times and they line multiple times and they just couldn\u2019t find one for me. just couldn\u2019t find one for me. Where is the money going? The Where is the money going? The district spent $255,000 in that district spent $255,000 in that pilot program, which generated pilot program, which generated 435 wheelchair taxi trips over 435 wheelchair taxi trips over six months. That\u2019s $586.21 per six months. That\u2019s $586.21 per ride. Not exactly a return on ride. Not exactly a return on investment to brag about. investment to brag about. Jonathan Rogers, the director of Jonathan Rogers, the director of DC\u2019s Department of for hire DC\u2019s Department of for hire vehicles, which spearheaded the vehicles, which spearheaded the pilot, wouldn\u2019t talk to us on pilot, wouldn\u2019t talk to us on camera, but he told the I-Team camera, but he told the I-Team Council, encouraged us to Council, encouraged us to experiment and figure out what experiment and figure out what would change behavior. So that\u2019s would change behavior. So that\u2019s what we did. He said he hoped it what we did. He said he hoped it would build momentum and that would build momentum and that the six new drivers added to the the six new drivers added to the program would stick with it. program would stick with it. Anyone without a wheelchair can Anyone without a wheelchair can get an Uber, Lyft or taxi get an Uber, Lyft or taxi whenever they want. It\u2019s just whenever they want. It\u2019s just not fair. Last fall, Naomi Hesse not fair. Last fall, Naomi Hesse had all her travel planned out had all her travel planned out so she could attend the Sabrina so she could attend the Sabrina Carpenter concert in Baltimore, Carpenter concert in Baltimore, but a delayed Amtrak train got but a delayed Amtrak train got her to Union Station at one in her to Union Station at one in the morning, leaving her with the morning, leaving her with few options. I was forced to few options. I was forced to walk home alone in the middle of walk home alone in the middle of the night. She says. It isn\u2019t the night. She says. It isn\u2019t like this everywhere in New York like this everywhere in New York City, there are more than 12,000 City, there are more than 12,000 wheelchair accessible taxis and wheelchair accessible taxis and rideshare vehicles. That city rideshare vehicles. That city says 46% of their taxi fleet is says 46% of their taxi fleet is wheelchair accessible. And by wheelchair accessible. And by law, anyone who now wants to law, anyone who now wants to start driving for a rideshare start driving for a rideshare company there must use an company there must use an accessible vehicle. Here in D.C, accessible vehicle. Here in D.C, Uber has a few, but didn\u2019t Uber has a few, but didn\u2019t respond to any of our questions respond to any of our questions about wheelchair vehicles. Lyft about wheelchair vehicles. Lyft has none in D.C, but does offer has none in D.C, but does offer them in nine other cities. They them in nine other cities. They told the I-Team it will continue told the I-Team it will continue to push for solutions that make to push for solutions that make rideshare as accessible as rideshare as accessible as possible for everyone. This one possible for everyone. This one needs a transmission. This one needs a transmission. This one needs a transmission. As for needs a transmission. As for taxis, none of the larger taxis, none of the larger companies in town would talk to companies in town would talk to us on camera, but did admit it us on camera, but did admit it is a challenge saying wheelchair is a challenge saying wheelchair accessible taxis are both accessible taxis are both expensive to buy and costly to expensive to buy and costly to maintain due mostly to their maintain due mostly to their weight and modifications, which weight and modifications, which could explain why we found so could explain why we found so many in their lots. Do you have many in their lots. Do you have an estimated time for riders an estimated time for riders like Kelly Mack, who just wants like Kelly Mack, who just wants to get to the store?

There are so many, again, 2 million federal again, 2 million federal employees, dozens and dozens of employees, dozens and dozens of agencies and bureaus and agencies and bureaus and divisions of, you know, any divisions of, you know, any number of departments. And I number of departments. And I really wanted a story about VA. really wanted a story about VA. And I come from a military And I come from a military family. My I have two uncles who family. My I have two uncles who were in the Army and an uncle were in the Army and an uncle who\u2019s a marine. My grandfather who\u2019s a marine. My grandfather served in World War Two. And, served in World War Two. And, you know, I feel like those are you know, I feel like those are stories that need to be told. stories that need to be told. And the VA is one of these parts And the VA is one of these parts of the federal government that of the federal government that has not historically been has not historically been politicized, but is increasingly politicized, but is increasingly so. So I thought a story there so. So I thought a story there might be a timely one. One of might be a timely one. One of the real reasons Ron is so the real reasons Ron is so appealing. It\u2019s just so easily appealing. It\u2019s just so easily blows up the stereotype of the blows up the stereotype of the inefficient, you know, useless inefficient, you know, useless government worker. He\u2019s he\u2019s government worker. He\u2019s he\u2019s anything but. So I was really anything but. So I was really drawn to Ron\u2019s excellence. And drawn to Ron\u2019s excellence. And truly his his team\u2019s dedication truly his his team\u2019s dedication to excellence day after day, to excellence day after day, just measuring the height of the just measuring the height of the grass, measuring the height of grass, measuring the height of the tombstones, realigning the tombstones, realigning everything day after day after everything day after day after day. And, you know, just just day. And, you know, just just absolute pursuit of perfection. absolute pursuit of perfection. Far, far beyond most private Far, far beyond most private companies. But in the case of companies. But in the case of VA, you know, something that VA, you know, something that surprised me was so much of what surprised me was so much of what we do for our veterans. It was we do for our veterans. It was Lincoln during the Civil War who Lincoln during the Civil War who decided that we would bury the decided that we would bury the dead. We would remove them from dead. We would remove them from these battlefields. And that these battlefields. And that commitment to gather and inter commitment to gather and inter them wherever their families them wherever their families wanted continued through World wanted continued through World War One, world War Two, War One, world War Two, tremendous efforts to repatriate tremendous efforts to repatriate the dead. And it\u2019s a truly the dead. And it\u2019s a truly extraordinary thing America extraordinary thing America does. And that\u2019s tremendously does. And that\u2019s tremendously moving to me, because we don\u2019t moving to me, because we don\u2019t have to do it as a country. But have to do it as a country. But we do. And I think it\u2019s one of we do. And I think it\u2019s one of the things that makes us great, the things that makes us great, to honor our commitment to these to honor our commitment to these people and to carry through the people and to carry through the promises we make. I think it\u2019s a promises we make. I think it\u2019s a really grievous time for our really grievous time for our country. And in a really deep country. And in a really deep and fundamental way, we have and fundamental way, we have taken for granted what makes taken for granted what makes this country excellent. You this country excellent. You know, many people in the world know, many people in the world live in places where government live in places where government is extremely corrupt. They live is extremely corrupt. They live in places where government is in places where government is extremely inadequate. They live extremely inadequate. They live in places where the apparatus of in places where the apparatus of government literally functions government literally functions to make their lives more to make their lives more difficult. And for decades, our difficult. And for decades, our civil service has just been civil service has just been devoted to the task of keeping devoted to the task of keeping us safe. So many things that us safe. So many things that that threaten our lives that that threaten our lives that it\u2019s the federal government, the it\u2019s the federal government, the invisible force that keeps us invisible force that keeps us safe and keeps the country safe and keeps the country running. But I hope that if running. But I hope that if people read whose government people read whose government they\u2019re moved to speak out and they\u2019re moved to speak out and share their stories, the federal share their stories, the federal workforce is tremendously workforce is tremendously distributed across the country. distributed across the country. It\u2019s not only in Washington. So It\u2019s not only in Washington. So wherever you live, whatever work wherever you live, whatever work you do, I hope you\u2019re encouraged you do, I hope you\u2019re encouraged to speak out about the parts of to speak out about the parts of government that have served your government that have served your family\u2019s needs, and I hope the family\u2019s needs, and I hope the book becomes an occasion to say book becomes an occasion to say thanks and to celebrate these thanks and to celebrate these people, because there\u2019s kind of people, because there\u2019s kind of never been a more critical time never been a more critical time to just stand up and go to a to just stand up and go to a town hall or post a message on town hall or post a message on social media.

Yeah, it to study the issue. Yeah, it comes as the FDA announces, or comes as the FDA announces, or the EPA, that it\u2019s reviewing new the EPA, that it\u2019s reviewing new information on potential health information on potential health risks with fluoride in our risks with fluoride in our drinking water. Investigative drinking water. Investigative reporter Tracee Wilkins has been reporter Tracee Wilkins has been following this issue and joins following this issue and joins us for more context with new us for more context with new recommendations and what they recommendations and what they could mean for our region. could mean for our region. Robert Kennedy Jr. Said, this is Robert Kennedy Jr. Said, this is something President Trump would something President Trump would do on day one. That did not do on day one. That did not happen, but Kennedy is pushing happen, but Kennedy is pushing for it now. The federal for it now. The federal government does not set the government does not set the standard for water fluoridation standard for water fluoridation that\u2019s done by states and local that\u2019s done by states and local governments, but they largely governments, but they largely follow the CDC\u2019s guidance follow the CDC\u2019s guidance because it\u2019s considered the best because it\u2019s considered the best scientific standard and has been scientific standard and has been for decades. Fluoride is added for decades. Fluoride is added to water by the different water to water by the different water suppliers in our region. Some suppliers in our region. Some meet or exceed CDC meet or exceed CDC recommendations in order to help recommendations in order to help prevent tooth decay. Kennedy, prevent tooth decay. Kennedy, who oversees the CDC, cannot who oversees the CDC, cannot order communities to stop order communities to stop fluoridation in water. Providers fluoridation in water. Providers in our region have said they in our region have said they plan to continue the process plan to continue the process when we checked, but the health when we checked, but the health secretary can direct the CDC to secretary can direct the CDC to stop recommending it. The U.S. stop recommending it. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Environmental Protection Agency sets the maximum level of sets the maximum level of fluoride allowed in public fluoride allowed in public water, and no systems are water, and no systems are allowed to surpass that. The EPA allowed to surpass that. The EPA standard for changing its policy standard for changing its policy has a much higher bar than the has a much higher bar than the CDC requires, and it requires an CDC requires, and it requires an evidence base. We spoke with the evidence base. We spoke with the public health attorney on what public health attorney on what that means. EPA could change its that means. EPA could change its regulations, but they can\u2019t do regulations, but they can\u2019t do so without an evidence base. The so without an evidence base. The legal standard is that they legal standard is that they can\u2019t act in an arbitrary and can\u2019t act in an arbitrary and capricious manner, so they can\u2019t capricious manner, so they can\u2019t just withdraw the regulation and just withdraw the regulation and then say, there can be no then say, there can be no fluoride in public waters fluoride in public waters because they would get sued. And because they would get sued. And so I think it would be so I think it would be incredibly difficult for the EPA incredibly difficult for the EPA to say there could be no to say there could be no fluoride at all or some fluoride at all or some minuscule level in public waters minuscule level in public waters and have that survive litigation and have that survive litigation and Kennedy\u2019s fight to remove and Kennedy\u2019s fight to remove fluoride. He has connected it to fluoride. He has connected it to lowering IQs in children and lowering IQs in children and causing bone breaks and disease. causing bone breaks and disease.
