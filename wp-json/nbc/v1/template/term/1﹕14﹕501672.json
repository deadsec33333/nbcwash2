Brandon Aiyuk and Deebo Samuel Brandon Aiyuk and Deebo Samuel played together for the San played together for the San Francisco 49ers. Brandon Aiyuk Francisco 49ers. Brandon Aiyuk very publicly made clear how very publicly made clear how close he and Jayden Daniels close he and Jayden Daniels were. If you go back to last were. If you go back to last year there was all this talk year there was all this talk about trading for Aiyuk. That about trading for Aiyuk. That never happened. They got Deebo never happened. They got Deebo instead. But Deebo has been instead.

Win Jayden has done throughout. Win the Heisman, win the rookie of the Heisman, win the rookie of the year. All Jayden does is the year. All Jayden does is impress. That\u2019s got to be one of impress. That\u2019s got to be one of the big reasons Deebo is so the big reasons Deebo is so excited. It also doesn\u2019t hurt excited. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that Washington decided to go that Washington decided to go ahead and guarantee about $17 ahead and guarantee about $17 million in salary for this million in salary for this season. That would make anybody season. That would make anybody happy too. Now let\u2019s talk about happy too. Now let\u2019s talk about another free agent Washington another free agent Washington brought back. This would be brought back. This would be defensive lineman Clelin defensive lineman Clelin Ferrell. Now, what they\u2019re Ferrell. Now, what they\u2019re saying is Ferrell talking about saying is Ferrell talking about what Washington\u2019s defense can be what Washington\u2019s defense can be now that they\u2019re getting guys now that they\u2019re getting guys back and bringing some new guys back and bringing some new guys in. It\u2019s just it\u2019s just suggest in. It\u2019s just it\u2019s just suggest that we\u2019re not complacent. You that we\u2019re not complacent. You know we always trying to find know we always trying to find ways to get better. And ways to get better. And regardless of whatever happened regardless of whatever happened last year, it\u2019s in the past. And last year, it\u2019s in the past. And you got to you got to reload. you got to you got to reload. You got to reload the clip and You got to reload the clip and try to get better and have a try to get better and have a chance to come out, because chance to come out, because everybody\u2019s getting better right everybody\u2019s getting better right now. So that\u2019s what I see, and now. So that\u2019s what I see, and I\u2019m excited about all the new I\u2019m excited about all the new guys we have in the room. We all guys we have in the room. We all just want to come in and just want to come in and compete, try to earn, earn, earn compete, try to earn, earn, earn everything that\u2019s given to us. everything that\u2019s given to us. So I\u2019m excited. I mean, one of So I\u2019m excited. I mean, one of the biggest things, you know, the biggest things, you know, outside of, you know, just the outside of, you know, just the different physical things that different physical things that we do is that you can ask a lot we do is that you can ask a lot more out of the room that we more out of the room that we have now, because if you, you have now, because if you, you know, if you look at the D line know, if you look at the D line or just the guys that we signed, or just the guys that we signed, a lot of veterans, you know, a a lot of veterans, you know, a lot of a lot of guys that have lot of a lot of guys that have played a lot of ball. And played a lot of ball. And obviously we\u2019re a very multiple obviously we\u2019re a very multiple team. So just the aspect of team. So just the aspect of being able to do a lot of being able to do a lot of different things and you can put different things and you can put a lot of things on us and then a lot of things on us and then not seem as overwhelming. You not seem as overwhelming. You know, just with the veteran know, just with the veteran players that we have and that we players that we have and that we did sign, I think that\u2019s going did sign, I think that\u2019s going to be the biggest thing. Just to be the biggest thing. Just the just the aspect that we the just the aspect that we always, you know, there\u2019s always, you know, there\u2019s nothing that they feel like they nothing that they feel like they can\u2019t ask us to do. Really can\u2019t ask us to do. Really interesting comments there from interesting comments there from Ferrell. Of course, he was in Ferrell. Of course, he was in Washington last year when that D Washington last year when that D line had some good moments, but line had some good moments, but certainly took some bumps and certainly took some bumps and bruises too. Now it\u2019s easy and bruises too. Now it\u2019s easy and probably overly simplistic if probably overly simplistic if you want to say Will Ferrell you want to say Will Ferrell saying Jon Allen\u2019s gone and the saying Jon Allen\u2019s gone and the guys coming in are veterans and guys coming in are veterans and that they\u2019re more versatile, I that they\u2019re more versatile, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case at don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case at all. I don\u2019t think this has all. I don\u2019t think this has anything to do with Allen\u2019s anything to do with Allen\u2019s departure. I think they\u2019re just departure. I think they\u2019re just bringing in some guys with bringing in some guys with different body types. Javon different body types. Javon Kinlaw is really tall, and he\u2019s Kinlaw is really tall, and he\u2019s a different kind of player than a different kind of player than Washington has had. And then Washington has had. And then think about a guy like Dietrich think about a guy like Dietrich Wise who\u2019s a real run stopper on Wise who\u2019s a real run stopper on the edge. Think about Eddie the edge. Think about Eddie Goldman, a guy that goes 330. Goldman, a guy that goes 330. They haven\u2019t had that body type They haven\u2019t had that body type on this D line, probably since on this D line, probably since Pot roast or Chris Baker or Pot roast or Chris Baker or something. So they\u2019re bringing something. So they\u2019re bringing in different pieces that will in different pieces that will give the defense more give the defense more versatility. I don\u2019t think versatility. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an accident. Another that\u2019s an accident. Another thing that was not an accident. thing that was not an accident. Washington resigned the people\u2019s Washington resigned the people\u2019s punter tress way. Tress way. And punter tress way. Tress way.

Just to put that out there. There\u2019s a lot of change there. There\u2019s a lot of change here in Philly. And that is here in Philly. And that is because the Eagles went into because the Eagles went into this offseason knowing they this offseason knowing they wanted to keep all of their top wanted to keep all of their top players. They have a lot of players. They have a lot of players making a lot of money. players making a lot of money. And to do that and to continue And to do that and to continue to extend them like Lane Johnson to extend them like Lane Johnson and Saquon Barkley gave them and Saquon Barkley gave them raises. They needed to let some raises. They needed to let some of the players go. That really of the players go. That really developed here and got big money developed here and got big money in free agency, and now they in free agency, and now they need younger players to step up. need younger players to step up. So they\u2019ve lost about seven So they\u2019ve lost about seven players on defense. Some key players on defense.

So a lot of change in Philly. That\u2019s what change in Philly. That\u2019s what happens when you win the Super happens when you win the Super Bowl. But the Eagles hope they Bowl. But the Eagles hope they can continue to draft well and can continue to draft well and keep building their team that keep building their team that way and stay in contention.

OSA Odighizuwa, who is a resign. OSA Odighizuwa, who is a defensive tackle, because in the defensive tackle, because in the new system that Matt Eberflus, new system that Matt Eberflus, the new defensive coordinator the new defensive coordinator who was fired by the bears, is who was fired by the bears, is going to run the three technique going to run the three technique at the defensive tackle position at the defensive tackle position is important.

And for the first time history. And for the first time ever, they didn\u2019t win a ever, they didn\u2019t win a divisional game at MetLife divisional game at MetLife Stadium was empty. The offense Stadium was empty. The offense was anemic. Daniel Jones, once was anemic. Daniel Jones, once viewed as the franchise viewed as the franchise quarterback, was released in quarterback, was released in midseason, and I haven\u2019t even midseason, and I haven\u2019t even gotten to the Giants worst gotten to the Giants worst nightmare. Saquon Barkley nightmare. Saquon Barkley signing with the Eagles and signing with the Eagles and turning in one of the best turning in one of the best seasons by a running back in NFL seasons by a running back in NFL history.

Cornerback Paulson Adebo should Cornerback Paulson Adebo should help, as should safety Jevon help, as should safety Jevon Holland, but his arrival only Holland, but his arrival only shines a spotlight on the shines a spotlight on the decision to let Xavier McKinney decision to let Xavier McKinney walk in free agency. A year ago, walk in free agency. A year ago, all he did was play at an all all he did was play at an all pro level. Malik Nabers was a pro level. Malik Nabers was a revelation as a rookie. He was revelation as a rookie. He was really good. But who is getting really good. But who is getting him the football? Any excitement him the football? Any excitement following the Jameis Winston following the Jameis Winston signing was immediately tempered signing was immediately tempered by the decision to sign Russell by the decision to sign Russell Wilson, who\u2019s now in his third Wilson, who\u2019s now in his third team in three years. The Giants team in three years. The Giants hold the third pick in next hold the third pick in next month\u2019s draft and could still month\u2019s draft and could still select Cam Ward or Shedeur select Cam Ward or Shedeur Sanders. But is that really the Sanders. But is that really the best use of a premium pick when best use of a premium pick when you have so many holes on the you have so many holes on the roster? Only time will tell. But roster? Only time will tell. But another season like the last two another season like the last two and owner John Mara will and owner John Mara will certainly see more planes flying certainly see more planes flying over MetLife Stadium and over MetLife Stadium and dumpster fire might be the dumpster fire might be the nicest thing those banners have nicest thing those banners have to say. JP, back to you, Bruce. to say. JP, back to you, Bruce. Thank you very much. It\u2019s Thank you very much. It\u2019s remarkable what\u2019s happening with remarkable what\u2019s happening with the Giants. That\u2019s one of the the Giants. That\u2019s one of the most stable, well-run most stable, well-run organizations in the NFL. The organizations in the NFL. The Mara family\u2019s been in charge up Mara family\u2019s been in charge up there for probably close to 100 there for probably close to 100 years, for maybe more than 100 years, for maybe more than 100 years now, and yet they just years now, and yet they just can\u2019t get it right. And what I can\u2019t get it right. And what I say this all the time on my say this all the time on my radio show is that the NFL is radio show is that the NFL is about self-preservation. And about self-preservation. And right now you\u2019ve got a GM and right now you\u2019ve got a GM and Joe Shane and a head coach in Joe Shane and a head coach in Brian Daboll for them to bring Brian Daboll for them to bring in Jameis Winston and Russell in Jameis Winston and Russell Wilson in the same week, does Wilson in the same week, does that make any sense other than that make any sense other than they\u2019re trying to save their they\u2019re trying to save their job? And if those guys get seven job? And if those guys get seven wins out of that group, does wins out of that group, does that really help the Giants long that really help the Giants long term, especially when there\u2019s a term, especially when there\u2019s a manning possibly in next year\u2019s manning possibly in next year\u2019s draft?

Let\u2019s get it going here. My guy Ben Purcell asks the My guy Ben Purcell asks the first question is the running first question is the running back position a priority for back position a priority for Washington heading into the Washington heading into the draft? Great question Ben. I draft? Great question Ben. I don\u2019t know specifically. I think don\u2019t know specifically. I think Washington\u2019s front office, Adam Washington\u2019s front office, Adam Peters, they really subscribe to Peters, they really subscribe to a best player available theory a best player available theory that they want to take the best that they want to take the best guy that\u2019s there. And when you guy that\u2019s there. And when you draft at 29 and you really don\u2019t draft at 29 and you really don\u2019t have that many picks after all have that many picks after all these trades, we\u2019ll see what the these trades, we\u2019ll see what the priorities are. Certainly I priorities are. Certainly I think edge rusher maybe corner think edge rusher maybe corner got to be near the top. But got to be near the top. But running back is really deep in running back is really deep in this draft and they\u2019ve basically this draft and they\u2019ve basically brought back their entire brought back their entire running back room. I mean even running back room. I mean even Chris Rodriguez, Jerry Jeremy Chris Rodriguez, Jerry Jeremy McNichols those guys have been McNichols those guys have been resigned. But what Dan Quinn resigned. But what Dan Quinn always preaches competition. always preaches competition. That just because somebody That just because somebody resigned in March does not resigned in March does not guarantee them a roster spot in guarantee them a roster spot in September? Certainly I could see September? Certainly I could see a running back\u2019s name getting a running back\u2019s name getting called by the Burgundy and gold called by the Burgundy and gold in late April. Go number two. in late April. Go number two. What do we got? Ooh, the What do we got? Ooh, the suspense is killing me. Elliott suspense is killing me. Elliott or Elliott, I don\u2019t know, King or Elliott, I don\u2019t know, King Bo, 26, says. Do you believe Bo, 26, says. Do you believe that Washington Commanders that Washington Commanders should put Gallup at the two? should put Gallup at the two? No, no, no, this is nuts. You No, no, no, this is nuts. You put Gallup at the two and Debo put Gallup at the two and Debo in the slot are at running back in the slot are at running back due to Gallup is a better route due to Gallup is a better route runner. Listen, listen, let\u2019s runner. Listen, listen, let\u2019s all relax about Michael Gallup. all relax about Michael Gallup. Let\u2019s all relax about Michael Let\u2019s all relax about Michael Gallup. He\u2019s had some good Gallup. He\u2019s had some good seasons. Undeniably. He\u2019s shown seasons. Undeniably. He\u2019s shown some real vertical speed. But some real vertical speed. But it\u2019s been a few years, man. It\u2019s it\u2019s been a few years, man. It\u2019s been a few years. Remember that been a few years. Remember that the Commanders right now can the Commanders right now can have a 90 man roster. And have a 90 man roster. And Michael Gallup, while they\u2019re Michael Gallup, while they\u2019re excited to have him here and he excited to have him here and he chose to come to Washington, chose to come to Washington, that doesn\u2019t even guarantee him that doesn\u2019t even guarantee him a roster spot. When you\u2019re a roster spot. When you\u2019re talking about the number two talking about the number two wide receiver they drafted Luke wide receiver they drafted Luke McCaffrey last year. This is a McCaffrey last year. This is a draft and develop coaching draft and develop coaching staff. You\u2019ve got to hope Luke staff. You\u2019ve got to hope Luke McCaffrey is able to take a big McCaffrey is able to take a big step for this offense. I won\u2019t step for this offense. I won\u2019t be shocked if they draft another be shocked if they draft another wide receiver. Plus they brought wide receiver. Plus they brought back Noah Brown. Noah Brown was back Noah Brown. Noah Brown was the number two last year on a the number two last year on a highly functional offense. I highly functional offense. I think if anything you\u2019re talking think if anything you\u2019re talking about Terry Noah Brown, Debo so about Terry Noah Brown, Debo so chill with Michael Gallup. It\u2019s chill with Michael Gallup. It\u2019s terrific he\u2019s here. If he still terrific he\u2019s here. If he still has the vertical speed, that\u2019s a has the vertical speed, that\u2019s a great thing to have. But let\u2019s great thing to have. But let\u2019s all just relax a little. Daily all just relax a little. Daily income marketing I\u2019ll take some income marketing I\u2019ll take some of that. Do you think the of that. Do you think the offensive staff already has offensive staff already has communicated to Brandon Coleman communicated to Brandon Coleman whether he will play right whether he will play right tackle or at one of the guard tackle or at one of the guard spots, as he could be working on spots, as he could be working on different footwork techniques? different footwork techniques? Now? I imagine they called Now? I imagine they called Coleman when they traded for Coleman when they traded for Tunsil. I imagine that very Tunsil. I imagine that very much. But keep in mind, Coleman much. But keep in mind, Coleman played all over the place in played all over the place in college at TCU. I don\u2019t think college at TCU. I don\u2019t think the footwork stuff is going to the footwork stuff is going to be that much of an issue. But be that much of an issue. But keep in mind to right tackle. keep in mind to right tackle. Andrew Wiley reworked his deal. Andrew Wiley reworked his deal. Sam Cosmi, the right guard who Sam Cosmi, the right guard who plays kind of at that Pro Bowl plays kind of at that Pro Bowl level. He injured that knee in level. He injured that knee in the NFC title game. So Cosmi is the NFC title game. So Cosmi is likely going to start the season likely going to start the season on the PUP list. It seems likely on the PUP list. It seems likely that Sam Cosmi misses at least that Sam Cosmi misses at least the first month of the season. the first month of the season. Sam Cosmi injured his knee in Sam Cosmi injured his knee in late September. I mean, the I\u2019m late September. I mean, the I\u2019m sorry in late January just sorry in late January just project nine months, which is a project nine months, which is a pretty fast recovery from an ACL pretty fast recovery from an ACL and that gets you to October. So and that gets you to October. So I think they\u2019ll have more than I think they\u2019ll have more than enough spots at least to start enough spots at least to start things up. What are we going? things up. What are we going? One more here. Paul\u2019s banister. One more here. Paul\u2019s banister. I like the picture of the dog. I like the picture of the dog. Paul. Would it surprise anyone Paul. Would it surprise anyone if at the draft, the Commanders if at the draft, the Commanders went for a 75% to 25% split? went for a 75% to 25% split? That\u2019s a lot of math for me in That\u2019s a lot of math for me in favor of defensive players. favor of defensive players. First two players taken CB and D First two players taken CB and D line, maybe I think they\u2019re line, maybe I think they\u2019re going to go best player going to go best player available. Go back. Last year, available. Go back. Last year, nobody on earth thought they nobody on earth thought they were going d line at the top of were going d line at the top of the second round. Everybody the second round. Everybody thought there would be a tackle, thought there would be a tackle, right? Only it wasn\u2019t because right? Only it wasn\u2019t because Johnny Newton fell to them and Johnny Newton fell to them and they really wanted Newton. They they really wanted Newton. They thought he gave them a great thought he gave them a great opportunity. So if somebody opportunity. So if somebody falls to them at wideout, falls to them at wideout, running back, whatever it is, I running back, whatever it is, I think they\u2019re going to make that think they\u2019re going to make that move because they believe in move because they believe in their draft board. That\u2019s what their draft board. That\u2019s what good organizations do, even if good organizations do, even if it\u2019s a position where you might it\u2019s a position where you might not need to load it up. Frankly, people I have the opportunity to serve. That\u2019s what working for serve. That\u2019s what working for you is. We\u2019re back on all ears. you is. We\u2019re back on all ears. And as always, it\u2019s time to find And as always, it\u2019s time to find something to bet on. You think something to bet on. You think it\u2019s March? There\u2019s nothing to it\u2019s March? There\u2019s nothing to bet on. Wrong. Here we go. My bet on. Wrong. Here we go. My guy Bakari has found something guy Bakari has found something wacky. Washington Commanders to wacky. Washington Commanders to score one plus rushing TD in score one plus rushing TD in every regular season game this every regular season game this fall, plus 2200. So obviously fall, plus 2200. So obviously that\u2019s a long shot. That\u2019s Vegas that\u2019s a long shot. That\u2019s Vegas telling you it\u2019s unlikely. Why? telling you it\u2019s unlikely. Why? I kind of like it. Jayden I kind of like it. Jayden Daniels is going to be a heavy Daniels is going to be a heavy part in the rush game. So you\u2019re part in the rush game. So you\u2019re not just betting on running not just betting on running backs like for some teams, backs like for some teams, you\u2019re just betting on running you\u2019re just betting on running backs to score in every game. backs to score in every game. But you\u2019ve got Jayden Daniels But you\u2019ve got Jayden Daniels who\u2019s going to get touchdowns on who\u2019s going to get touchdowns on the ground. Oh by the way they the ground.

We\u2019re going all in on the Washington Commanders, and Washington Commanders, and everybody knows it was just a everybody knows it was just a few weeks ago that Washington few weeks ago that Washington decided to trade with San decided to trade with San Francisco for Deebo Samuel. Francisco for Deebo Samuel. Deebo instantly gives this Deebo instantly gives this offense a new weapon, a offense a new weapon, a different type of player, not different type of player, not necessarily a receiver, not necessarily a receiver, not necessarily a running back, but necessarily a running back, but an athlete, a chess piece, a an athlete, a chess piece, a Swiss Army knife. Now Washington Swiss Army knife. Now Washington got Deebo for a song. It only got Deebo for a song. It only cost him a fifth round pick. For cost him a fifth round pick. For a guy that has an all pro season a guy that has an all pro season on his resume, and is only two on his resume, and is only two years removed from almost a 1200 years removed from almost a 1200 yard season. But the big yard season. But the big question with Deebo was, are question with Deebo was, are they going to rework that deal? they going to rework that deal? Well, on Wednesday we got an Well, on Wednesday we got an answer. Adam Schefter reported answer. Adam Schefter reported that Washington and Deebo Samuel that Washington and Deebo Samuel reworked their deal to give him reworked their deal to give him $17 million guaranteed for the $17 million guaranteed for the 2025 season, and they added 2025 season, and they added another $3 million worth of another $3 million worth of incentives. It\u2019s my sense from incentives. It\u2019s my sense from talking to folks in Ashburn, talking to folks in Ashburn, this is about Dan Quinn, Adam this is about Dan Quinn, Adam Peters, Kliff Kingsbury telling Peters, Kliff Kingsbury telling Deebo, listen, we want you here. Deebo, listen, we want you here. And you know what I\u2019m hearing? And you know what I\u2019m hearing? The other players want Deebo The other players want Deebo here too. Here\u2019s Noah Brown on here too. Here\u2019s Noah Brown on Washington\u2019s new wideout. Deebo Washington\u2019s new wideout. Deebo is a great player. He\u2019s been a is a great player. He\u2019s been a great player in this league for great player in this league for a while. Very versatile. Brings a while. Very versatile. Brings a lot of toughness to our room, a lot of toughness to our room, a lot of physicality that I that a lot of physicality that I that I know will all benefit from. So I know will all benefit from. So I\u2019m excited to get out there and I\u2019m excited to get out there and work with him. You know it\u2019s work with him. You know it\u2019s just versatility. He can line up just versatility. He can line up in the backfield. He can play up in the backfield. He can play up the slot, he can play outside the slot, he can play outside and he\u2019s a real problem when he and he\u2019s a real problem when he gets the ball in his hands. So I gets the ball in his hands. So I think that is something that think that is something that defenses are going to be on high defenses are going to be on high alert for. And you know with the alert for. And you know with the quarterback we have Terry our quarterback we have Terry our other running backs. It just it other running backs. It just it puts a lot on defensive plates. puts a lot on defensive plates. And I think that you know we And I think that you know we will all benefit from it will all benefit from it including Deebo Noah Brown also including Deebo Noah Brown also signed back with Washington. signed back with Washington. He\u2019ll be on the team again this He\u2019ll be on the team again this fall was obviously a really fall was obviously a really important piece. Everybody important piece. Everybody remembers the Hail Mary, but he remembers the Hail Mary, but he was proving himself as a really was proving himself as a really good wide receiver prior to that good wide receiver prior to that internal organ injury late in internal organ injury late in the season. Back to Deebo. You the season. Back to Deebo. You can have some angst about them can have some angst about them guaranteeing this money if you guaranteeing this money if you want, but odds are they probably want, but odds are they probably had conversations about this way had conversations about this way back when they traded for him. back when they traded for him. And I think for Deebo, it shows And I think for Deebo, it shows a commitment to the team. If a commitment to the team. If Deebo delivers, he will be Deebo delivers, he will be underpaid. That\u2019s clear. If underpaid. That\u2019s clear. If Deebo delivers about what he did Deebo delivers about what he did last season in San Francisco, last season in San Francisco, 800 yards or so, he\u2019ll probably 800 yards or so, he\u2019ll probably be about properly paid. Remember be about properly paid. Remember Dyami Brown got $10 million in Dyami Brown got $10 million in free agency last week. Prices free agency last week. Prices for everything are going up now. for everything are going up now. Deebo Samuel wasn\u2019t the only big Deebo Samuel wasn\u2019t the only big trade that Washington made. trade that Washington made. Obviously the biggest one. The Obviously the biggest one.

That is a big time advantage for a guy like advantage for a guy like Kingsbury that likes to come up Kingsbury that likes to come up with schematic advantages all with schematic advantages all over the field. Oh, and by the over the field. Oh, and by the way, you introduced Deebo Samuel way, you introduced Deebo Samuel into that mix. That offense into that mix. That offense could be significantly better. could be significantly better. Now defensively, there\u2019s been Now defensively, there\u2019s been some questions. Has Washington some questions. Has Washington gotten that much better? One big gotten that much better? One big signing was Javon Kinlaw. Now signing was Javon Kinlaw. Now Kinlaw was in San Francisco when Kinlaw was in San Francisco when Adam Peters was last year was Adam Peters was last year was with the Jets. But for Kinlaw with the Jets. But for Kinlaw now he\u2019s coming home. Well, I now he\u2019s coming home. Well, I grew up in northeast D.C, so I\u2019m grew up in northeast D.C, so I\u2019m a real skin fan. Point blank a real skin fan. Point blank period. And I was just telling period. And I was just telling somebody when I was growing up, somebody when I was growing up, Trent Williams was on the team Trent Williams was on the team and Jordan Reed, and then I got and Jordan Reed, and then I got to be teammates with them guys to be teammates with them guys my rookie year. For me to be my rookie year. For me to be able to be on this team now is a able to be on this team now is a full circle moment for me, and I full circle moment for me, and I know a lot about the know a lot about the transformation, man, it was in transformation, man, it was in the blink of an eye. It\u2019s like the blink of an eye. It\u2019s like you go from zero to hero, you you go from zero to hero, you know what I mean? And that\u2019s know what I mean? And that\u2019s what all that\u2019s all I\u2019m about. what all that\u2019s all I\u2019m about. You know, that\u2019s kind of my You know, that\u2019s kind of my life. And I can\u2019t wait to thrive life. And I can\u2019t wait to thrive with these guys. Man, I feel so with these guys. Man, I feel so blessed and I\u2019m so happy to be blessed and I\u2019m so happy to be here. So my whole family here. here. So my whole family here. So I love those stories. And So I love those stories. And just think about this from an on just think about this from an on field perspective. Adam Peters field perspective. Adam Peters knows Kinlaw Darryl Tapp, knows Kinlaw Darryl Tapp, Washington\u2019s defensive line Washington\u2019s defensive line coach. He knows Kinlaw. They coach. He knows Kinlaw. They sought him out and brought him sought him out and brought him here on the first day of free here on the first day of free agency. Clearly, they think he agency. Clearly, they think he can really add an element to can really add an element to this defensive line. We haven\u2019t this defensive line. We haven\u2019t seen it yet. That doesn\u2019t mean seen it yet. That doesn\u2019t mean that the team hasn\u2019t seen it that the team hasn\u2019t seen it yet. Now let\u2019s get into yet. Now let\u2019s get into something else here. I want to something else here. I want to get back to what they\u2019re saying get back to what they\u2019re saying because Marcus Mariota resigned because Marcus Mariota resigned with Washington. I think this is with Washington. I think this is a huge deal to keep the a huge deal to keep the continuity in that quarterback continuity in that quarterback room. But it also means a lot to room. But it also means a lot to Mariota and Jayden. Well I think Mariota and Jayden. Well I think it was always the right fit. I it was always the right fit. I think for me it was more of an think for me it was more of an ego and pride thing of seeing ego and pride thing of seeing what was out there and seeing if what was out there and seeing if I could maybe get another shot I could maybe get another shot at it. I will never close that at it. I will never close that door if that opportunity door if that opportunity presents itself as a competitor, presents itself as a competitor, I got to take it. But like I was I got to take it. But like I was saying earlier, there had to be saying earlier, there had to be something that was just very something that was just very like unbelievable that you like unbelievable that you couldn\u2019t pass up. That would couldn\u2019t pass up. That would have made me leave. And at the have made me leave. And at the end of the day, after everything end of the day, after everything and having all these and having all these discussions, this was the right discussions, this was the right fit. And I\u2019m very, very excited fit. And I\u2019m very, very excited to be back. When you have a room to be back. When you have a room that\u2019s predicated on making sure that\u2019s predicated on making sure that the guy that\u2019s playing is that the guy that\u2019s playing is ready to roll and you give him ready to roll and you give him everything that he needs and everything that he needs and that room is intact, I think that room is intact, I think that\u2019s huge. So the more that we that\u2019s huge. So the more that we can get Jay continuing to play, can get Jay continuing to play, how he\u2019s been playing, how he\u2019s been playing, continuing to give him that continuing to give him that confidence, I think really it confidence, I think really it breeds life not only into our breeds life not only into our room but into our entire into room but into our entire into the entire team. So I\u2019m I\u2019m so the entire team. So I\u2019m I\u2019m so excited to be back. Like I said, excited to be back. Like I said, it\u2019s just it was such a fun team it\u2019s just it was such a fun team and fun environment to be in and fun environment to be in that I\u2019m just I\u2019m I\u2019m really that I\u2019m just I\u2019m I\u2019m really looking forward to April and looking forward to April and getting things going again. What getting things going again. What maturity from Mariota I mean maturity from Mariota I mean what an incredible attitude. And what an incredible attitude. And I love that he\u2019s honest. These I love that he\u2019s honest. These are elite athletes that all want are elite athletes that all want to play. And of course Mariota to play. And of course Mariota is going to at least look around is going to at least look around and see what\u2019s out there. But as and see what\u2019s out there. But as soon as he realized that kind of soon as he realized that kind of that that magical spot wasn\u2019t that that magical spot wasn\u2019t there. I want to be in there. I want to be in Washington. I want to be with Washington. I want to be with Jayden Daniels. You saw the shot Jayden Daniels. You saw the shot of Mariota helping Jayden of Mariota helping Jayden Daniels there towards the end of Daniels there towards the end of the Atlanta game, as Jayden was the Atlanta game, as Jayden was just gassed. That game went to just gassed. That game went to overtime if I remember overtime if I remember correctly. And Mariota correctly. And Mariota throughout the season was a throughout the season was a leader and a friend to Jayden leader and a friend to Jayden Daniels. And by the way when he Daniels. And by the way when he was on the field he was was on the field he was excellent. Think about the week excellent. Think about the week 18 game at Dallas where he 18 game at Dallas where he engineered that comeback and the engineered that comeback and the touchdown throw to Terry touchdown throw to Terry McLaurin at the end. That\u2019s a McLaurin at the end. That\u2019s a dude you want back in your dude you want back in your quarterback room. That\u2019s a win quarterback room. That\u2019s a win for all parties involved. Now for all parties involved. Now speaking of all parties involved speaking of all parties involved in the running back room, Jeremy in the running back room, Jeremy McNichols carved out an McNichols carved out an important role for Washington important role for Washington last season. He\u2019s also back with last season. He\u2019s also back with the Burgundy and Gold. Remember, the Burgundy and Gold. Remember, McNichols had four touchdowns McNichols had four touchdowns last year. But he says last year. But he says expectations are only going up. expectations are only going up. I think it brings a lot of I think it brings a lot of confidence. You know, we have confidence. You know, we have something to build upon. We something to build upon. We built a started to build a solid built a started to build a solid foundation last year. And I foundation last year. And I think with the guys coming in, think with the guys coming in, the expectations that you had the expectations that you had when you come to the Commanders when you come to the Commanders now and the expectations that we now and the expectations that we have when we go play on on have when we go play on on Sunday, but nobody holds a Sunday, but nobody holds a higher expectations than we hold higher expectations than we hold in this building. So I just in this building. So I just think just having something to think just having something to build on and knowing the build on and knowing the playbook and knowing, you know, playbook and knowing, you know, just having familiar faces just having familiar faces around throughout the building around throughout the building is a is a great advantage for is a is a great advantage for us. It really could be. If you us. It really could be. If you think about offensively, they think about offensively, they had to start at square one last had to start at square one last year. New quarterback, new year. New quarterback, new coaches, new everything. coaches, new everything. Nothing\u2019s really new anymore. Nothing\u2019s really new anymore. Obviously you\u2019re going to add Obviously you\u2019re going to add some new pieces. Deebo Samuel, some new pieces. Deebo Samuel, Laremy Tunsil, whatever might Laremy Tunsil, whatever might happen in the draft. But happen in the draft. But everybody has an understanding everybody has an understanding of what the standard is in that of what the standard is in that building and how they operate, building and how they operate, and maybe they\u2019ll be able to do and maybe they\u2019ll be able to do that much better. Now we have a that much better. Now we have a very special version of what you very special version of what you missed. We already talked about missed. We already talked about Javon Kinlaw coming back to DC. Javon Kinlaw coming back to DC. Does anybody remember Eddie Does anybody remember Eddie Goldman was an absolute high Goldman was an absolute high school star in Washington at school star in Washington at Friendship Collegiate Academy, Friendship Collegiate Academy, was a draft pick by the Chicago was a draft pick by the Chicago Bears in 2015 after he played Bears in 2015 after he played his college ball at Florida his college ball at Florida State, was a second round pick State, was a second round pick by the bears. There\u2019s some by the bears. There\u2019s some highlights from back in the high highlights from back in the high school days, and you got to hear school days, and you got to hear Eddie talking going way back now Eddie talking going way back now to 2011 about what his future to 2011 about what his future was going to be like when he was going to be like when he left DC. Yeah, okay. I\u2019m like, left DC. Yeah, okay. I\u2019m like, I\u2019m the man in high school. But I\u2019m the man in high school. But when I go to college, it\u2019s like when I go to college, it\u2019s like I\u2019m at the bottom of the depth I\u2019m at the bottom of the depth chart, you know? So I mean, I chart, you know? So I mean, I really haven\u2019t done anything really haven\u2019t done anything yet. So like, I\u2019m not big headed yet. So like, I\u2019m not big headed because I know when I get to because I know when I get to college, I mean, it\u2019s all going college, I mean, it\u2019s all going to, you know, go away. The to, you know, go away. The process was it was real easy, process was it was real easy, man. They reached out and it was man. They reached out and it was kind of a no brainer. You know. kind of a no brainer. You know. You know it was home team, my You know it was home team, my favorite team as a child you favorite team as a child you know. And it\u2019s a great team. So know. And it\u2019s a great team. So it was a no brainer. The it was a no brainer. The drought. Wait wait wait what do drought. Wait wait wait what do you mean by that. You know we you mean by that. You know we you know, historically, you you know, historically, you know, when I was like, you know, know, when I was like, you know, elementary, middle school, we elementary, middle school, we wasn\u2019t like a winning team like wasn\u2019t like a winning team like that, you know? So it was a lot that, you know? So it was a lot of hardships, you know, what a of hardships, you know, what a cool story. Another guy coming cool story. Another guy coming back to DC, back to his hometown back to DC, back to his hometown with a chance to be part of a with a chance to be part of a winning organization. When winning organization. When Goldman talks about the drought, Goldman talks about the drought, he ain\u2019t lying. He was born in he ain\u2019t lying. He was born in 94. He was born after all the 94. He was born after all the Super Bowls, the Joe Gibbs, John Super Bowls, the Joe Gibbs, John Riggins, Darrell Green. He Riggins, Darrell Green. He doesn\u2019t remember any of that. doesn\u2019t remember any of that. And there\u2019s so many young people And there\u2019s so many young people in our area that are in the same in our area that are in the same boat. So let\u2019s hope Jayden boat. So let\u2019s hope Jayden Daniels, this new operation Daniels, this new operation they\u2019ve got over in Ashburn are they\u2019ve got over in Ashburn are going to create new memories. going to create new memories. Last year. They certainly did Last year. They certainly did time to build on it. Now when we time to build on it. Now when we come back, March is all about serve. That\u2019s what working for you is. This is All Ears with JP you is. This is All Ears with JP Finlay. We are back on all ears Finlay. We are back on all ears now when you get to this time of now when you get to this time of year. March. Everybody wants to year. March. Everybody wants to talk about the madness. So we talk about the madness. So we tried to come up with our own tried to come up with our own version of it. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re version of it. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. We\u2019re starting with going to do. We\u2019re starting with the coming in bracket. These are the coming in bracket. These are players that are arriving in players that are arriving in Washington. One seed Laremy Washington. One seed Laremy Tunsil, four seed Will Harris Tunsil, four seed Will Harris could be a really important could be a really important piece in the secondary. piece in the secondary. Obviously we\u2019ve talked plenty Obviously we\u2019ve talked plenty about Deebo Samuel and then about Deebo Samuel and then you\u2019ve got Javon Kinlaw. Now you\u2019ve got Javon Kinlaw. Now who\u2019s the most important of this who\u2019s the most important of this group. I think this bracket is group. I think this bracket is going to be pretty chalky. It\u2019s going to be pretty chalky. It\u2019s obviously going to be you got obviously going to be you got Tunsil and you got Deebo. Both Tunsil and you got Deebo. Both of these guys are huge additions of these guys are huge additions to this offense. Tunsil at left to this offense. Tunsil at left tackle. You can argue that\u2019s a tackle. You can argue that\u2019s a more important position, but if more important position, but if Deebo is right, he\u2019s one of the Deebo is right, he\u2019s one of the most explosive players in the most explosive players in the NFL. So this is a really tight NFL. So this is a really tight contest. They had to make trades contest. They had to make trades for both of these guys. But if for both of these guys. But if you got to pick a winner. We\u2019ll you got to pick a winner. We\u2019ll come back to that because it\u2019s come back to that because it\u2019s the coming back bracket. Now the coming back bracket. Now look we got Bobby Wagner as your look we got Bobby Wagner as your one seed tress way the people\u2019s one seed tress way the people\u2019s punter he\u2019s on here. He\u2019s a fan punter he\u2019s on here. He\u2019s a fan favorite and he\u2019s really good at favorite and he\u2019s really good at what he does Zach Ertz was huge what he does Zach Ertz was huge for this offense. And then for this offense. And then Marcus Mariota you heard me talk Marcus Mariota you heard me talk about his importance to the about his importance to the continuity of that quarterback continuity of that quarterback room. How that helps Jayden room. How that helps Jayden Daniels and how well he played. Daniels and how well he played. But for me this one\u2019s not that But for me this one\u2019s not that difficult. If you\u2019re talking difficult. If you\u2019re talking about the most important guys about the most important guys here it\u2019s Wagner and it\u2019s Ertz. here it\u2019s Wagner and it\u2019s Ertz. These guys were leaders of the These guys were leaders of the offense and the defense offense and the defense specifically. I think you had to specifically. I think you had to bring both of these fellas back. bring both of these fellas back. I think there\u2019s a reason they I think there\u2019s a reason they got those deals done before free got those deals done before free agency opened. It\u2019s because agency opened. It\u2019s because Washington didn\u2019t even want to Washington didn\u2019t even want to risk losing those guys. So what risk losing those guys. So what have we got left. The Final have we got left. The Final four. That\u2019s where I hope four. That\u2019s where I hope Maryland goes. That\u2019s where Maryland goes. That\u2019s where everybody wants to see what everybody wants to see what happens. Right. So in the new happens. Right. So in the new guy bracket, Tunsil versus Debo guy bracket, Tunsil versus Debo I really, really like Debo. I really, really like Debo. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think he Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think he could be wildly explosive for could be wildly explosive for Washington. All the stuff at the Washington. All the stuff at the line of scrimmage that Kliff line of scrimmage that Kliff Kingsbury likes to do, those Kingsbury likes to do, those little shallow crossers. Last little shallow crossers. Last year you had Dyami Brown, year you had Dyami Brown, Olamide, Zacchaeus running Olamide, Zacchaeus running those. Both of those guys are those. Both of those guys are elsewhere now, but now you got elsewhere now, but now you got an athlete like Debo running an athlete like Debo running those. I think Debo is poised to those. I think Debo is poised to have a monster year in have a monster year in Washington. I think that\u2019s why Washington. I think that\u2019s why they guaranteed some of the they guaranteed some of the money. But let\u2019s be real, left money. But let\u2019s be real, left tackle blocking for Jayden tackle blocking for Jayden cementing you know, offensive cementing you know, offensive line. That was pretty good line. That was pretty good especially when healthy last especially when healthy last year. But that offensive line year. But that offensive line gets to take a monster step up. gets to take a monster step up. And then on the bottom half of And then on the bottom half of this the guys that stuck around this the guys that stuck around give me Bobby Wagner I\u2019m give me Bobby Wagner I\u2019m switching sides I need Camara to switching sides I need Camara to give me lessons on this thing. give me lessons on this thing. But if you think about Wagner, But if you think about Wagner, the defense if you don\u2019t bring the defense if you don\u2019t bring him back, he\u2019s an all pro him back, he\u2019s an all pro linebacker. We know this offense linebacker. We know this offense can cook. We saw them do it even can cook. We saw them do it even without a stud left tackle last without a stud left tackle last season Bobby Wagner. If you season Bobby Wagner. If you don\u2019t have Bobby Wagner what don\u2019t have Bobby Wagner what exactly does that defense look exactly does that defense look like. Because there haven\u2019t been like. Because there haven\u2019t been massive upgrades via free massive upgrades via free agency. There haven\u2019t really agency. There haven\u2019t really been the trades on the defensive been the trades on the defensive side of the ball. Wagner to me side of the ball. Wagner to me might be the most important might be the most important person that Washington has person that Washington has signed or resigned in this signed or resigned in this offseason. That might seem offseason. That might seem crazy. Tunsil is a huge crazy. Tunsil is a huge addition. Debo is a huge addition. Debo is a huge addition, but the offense was addition, but the offense was good already. Defensively, they good already. Defensively, they were decent. They were good were decent. They were good enough. But if you take Wagner enough. But if you take Wagner off that group, I\u2019m not sure off that group, I\u2019m not sure what you got. He was an all pro. what you got. He was an all pro. He was a captain for you. Wagner He was a captain for you. Wagner was huge. And all of these was huge. And all of these signings, everybody that made signings, everybody that made our big board and our brackets our big board and our brackets important to Washington. But I important to Washington. But I think Wagner takes the crown in think Wagner takes the crown in the All Ears bracket. Now, when the opportunity to serve. That\u2019s what working for you is. This is what working for you is. This is All Ears with JP Finlay. Welcome All Ears with JP Finlay. Welcome back. It\u2019s all yours. And it\u2019s back. It\u2019s all yours. And it\u2019s your turn. Every week we take a your turn. Every week we take a bunch of questions via social bunch of questions via social media, usually Twitter or X or media, usually Twitter or X or whatever you want to call it, whatever you want to call it, but I don\u2019t know, you can hit me but I don\u2019t know, you can hit me up from wherever. Jummy Olabanji up from wherever. Jummy Olabanji said she was going to email me. said she was going to email me. I\u2019m waiting Jummy you email me, I\u2019m waiting Jummy you email me, you will get on all ears. That you will get on all ears. That is a promise. Let\u2019s get to this is a promise. Let\u2019s get to this week\u2019s batch of questions. We week\u2019s batch of questions. We usually get lots of them. Let\u2019s usually get lots of them. Let\u2019s start by man. KB, DMV versus KB start by man. KB, DMV versus KB says last year was a says last year was a recalibration and they willed recalibration and they willed themselves to an NFC title game. themselves to an NFC title game. What should fans expect this What should fans expect this season? What should the front season? What should the front office and players expect as office and players expect as well? Here\u2019s what I know about well? Here\u2019s what I know about Dan Quinn the way he runs his Dan Quinn the way he runs his program and Adam Peters too. program and Adam Peters too. It\u2019s all about competition and It\u2019s all about competition and steady improvement. So you want steady improvement. So you want to see competition and steady to see competition and steady improvement. Now, that doesn\u2019t improvement. Now, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the only way to necessarily mean the only way to improve from an NFC title game improve from an NFC title game would be to go to a Super Bowl. would be to go to a Super Bowl. I don\u2019t think you can put those I don\u2019t think you can put those types of expectations on types of expectations on something when every year, every something when every year, every season in the NFL, every game in season in the NFL, every game in the NFL is kind of its own the NFL is kind of its own living, breathing organism. living, breathing organism. Every season is a is a really Every season is a is a really finite resource. So every year finite resource. So every year is different. If it wasn\u2019t, is different. If it wasn\u2019t, people would make money hand people would make money hand over fist betting in the NFL. over fist betting in the NFL. They don\u2019t because every week They don\u2019t because every week you never know what to expect. you never know what to expect. You need health first and You need health first and foremost. And you just you can\u2019t foremost. And you just you can\u2019t guarantee that in a really guarantee that in a really physical league. For me, I think physical league. For me, I think fair expectations with what fair expectations with what they\u2019ve established, especially they\u2019ve established, especially what they can do offensively and what they can do offensively and just how special of a player just how special of a player Jayden Daniels is, they\u2019ve Jayden Daniels is, they\u2019ve entered that category for me, entered that category for me, where the divisional round of where the divisional round of the playoffs should at least be the playoffs should at least be part of the conversation. When part of the conversation. When you have a top eight you have a top eight quarterback, a top five quarterback, a top five quarterback, you\u2019re always quarterback, you\u2019re always thinking about January football. thinking about January football. That should be the driver. That should be the driver. Whether that means you win the Whether that means you win the NFC East or your wild card team, NFC East or your wild card team, you get in and you got to win you get in and you got to win some games like they did this some games like they did this year. I think you\u2019re talking year. I think you\u2019re talking about the second round of the about the second round of the playoffs. That, at least to me, playoffs. That, at least to me, is the expectation. Let\u2019s keep is the expectation. Let\u2019s keep these moving. Question number these moving. Question number two. How often do you think two. How often do you think Deebo will be lined up in the Deebo will be lined up in the backfield? Great question. This backfield? Great question. This is from Tanner Kirkpatrick. is from Tanner Kirkpatrick. Tanner appreciate you watching Tanner appreciate you watching and hanging out via social I and hanging out via social I don\u2019t know I don\u2019t know the don\u2019t know I don\u2019t know the frequency. I think the better frequency. I think the better numbers to look at would be numbers to look at would be debo\u2019s usage in San Francisco debo\u2019s usage in San Francisco before Christian McCaffrey before Christian McCaffrey showed up, because obviously showed up, because obviously once they traded for McCaffrey, once they traded for McCaffrey, Debo\u2019s role changed a little bit Debo\u2019s role changed a little bit because McCaffrey became your because McCaffrey became your workhorse. Before McCaffrey, workhorse. Before McCaffrey, they didn\u2019t have an exact they didn\u2019t have an exact workhorse or probably more workhorse or probably more carries for Deebo in the carries for Deebo in the backfield. I think Washington backfield. I think Washington would. B-Rob Ekeler. They would. B-Rob Ekeler. They brought their whole running back brought their whole running back room back. They\u2019re not desperate room back. They\u2019re not desperate to get Deebo carries. But I to get Deebo carries. But I think they want to get him think they want to get him touches I think they want to get touches I think they want to get him involved early. I certainly him involved early. I certainly think he\u2019s going to be a part of think he\u2019s going to be a part of the backfield rotation. He could the backfield rotation. He could also line up in the backfield also line up in the backfield and still go out for passes. It and still go out for passes. It doesn\u2019t necessarily necessarily doesn\u2019t necessarily necessarily mean he\u2019s going to be getting mean he\u2019s going to be getting carries, but he\u2019s going to be carries, but he\u2019s going to be all over the field. Kliff all over the field. Kliff Kingsbury is an innovator and Kingsbury is an innovator and he\u2019ll be innovative with Debo, he\u2019ll be innovative with Debo, Jason R says, who\u2019s someone who Jason R says, who\u2019s someone who was on the roster that will have was on the roster that will have a larger role this year than a larger role this year than they did last year. For me, you they did last year. For me, you got to think, rookies, I think got to think, rookies, I think Johnny Newton. I think the Johnny Newton. I think the development of Johnny Newton, development of Johnny Newton, frankly, was a big reason why frankly, was a big reason why Washington decided, hey John Washington decided, hey John Allen, we love you. You\u2019ve been Allen, we love you. You\u2019ve been great for the organization, but great for the organization, but we\u2019re going to let you walk. I we\u2019re going to let you walk. I think they see a lot in Newton. think they see a lot in Newton. And I would look at Luke And I would look at Luke McCaffrey. I would look at Ben McCaffrey. I would look at Ben Senate. Those are guys that Senate. Those are guys that played last season. But the played last season. But the offensive production wasn\u2019t offensive production wasn\u2019t really there. I think this is really there. I think this is supposed to be a draft and supposed to be a draft and develop program. The coaches develop program. The coaches want to develop players. Adam want to develop players. Adam Peters wants to build through Peters wants to build through the draft. You need your guys the draft. You need your guys from last year to step up a from last year to step up a level this coming season. All level this coming season. All right. Let\u2019s get to another right. Let\u2019s get to another question here. Who do we got? question here. Who do we got? Where are we going? I never know Where are we going? I never know when it\u2019s going to be silly or when it\u2019s going to be silly or serious. Jimmy Alderson I hope I serious. Jimmy Alderson I hope I got that right. Says how has got that right. Says how has your job changed good and bad, your job changed good and bad, since the team is back doing since the team is back doing well again? Broad question how well again? Broad question how is my job changed? Honestly, is my job changed? Honestly, last year was probably the most last year was probably the most fun I had professionally. I mean fun I had professionally. I mean to cover. I had never covered a to cover. I had never covered a winning playoff game for the winning playoff game for the Burgundy and gold I\u2019d cover. I Burgundy and gold I\u2019d cover. I had covered other playoff games, had covered other playoff games, I had covered Super Bowls for I had covered Super Bowls for NBC and lots of things, but NBC and lots of things, but never for the Burgundy and gold. never for the Burgundy and gold. So that was a career highlight. So that was a career highlight. Winning locker rooms are way Winning locker rooms are way more fun than losing locker more fun than losing locker rooms, but you still have a job rooms, but you still have a job to do. I still have to approach to do. I still have to approach it professionally. The only it professionally. The only thing that\u2019s gotten different, I thing that\u2019s gotten different, I would say, is and some of it would say, is and some of it might be, you know, increased might be, you know, increased role here at NBC, but the amount role here at NBC, but the amount of people that stop and want to of people that stop and want to talk to me about what Washington talk to me about what Washington is doing has increased is doing has increased tremendously. And the type of tremendously. And the type of people, it\u2019s everybody under the people, it\u2019s everybody under the sun. They love talking to me at sun. They love talking to me at giant, especially when I have my giant, especially when I have my kids. It\u2019s a blast. We got one kids. It\u2019s a blast. We got one thing left. I think we got the serve. That\u2019s what working for you is. This is All Ears with JP you is. This is All Ears with JP Finlay. Oh, hey. Sorry I wasn\u2019t Finlay. Oh, hey. Sorry I wasn\u2019t working on my bracket. I would working on my bracket. I would never be working on my bracket never be working on my bracket while we\u2019re doing all ears. while we\u2019re doing all ears. Ever, ever, ever. I would never Ever, ever, ever. I would never be doing that. Let\u2019s get to the be doing that. Let\u2019s get to the weekend line. Let\u2019s focus weekend line. Let\u2019s focus everybody. Weekend line time. everybody. Weekend line time. This is the time of year for This is the time of year for degenerate betting. And boy oh degenerate betting. And boy oh boy. If you\u2019re looking for NFL boy. If you\u2019re looking for NFL bets in March, we got something bets in March, we got something for you. 2025 NFL Draft. Who\u2019s for you. 2025 NFL Draft. Who\u2019s Washington going to take first? Washington going to take first? Now keep in mind this language Now keep in mind this language is fairly vague. They\u2019re not is fairly vague. They\u2019re not saying first round pick or the saying first round pick or the 29th overall pick which they 29th overall pick which they currently hold because there currently hold because there could always be trades. So keep could always be trades. So keep in mind why some of the numbers in mind why some of the numbers might look a little different might look a little different than you\u2019d expect. These are than you\u2019d expect. These are odds offered by DraftKings, but odds offered by DraftKings, but they\u2019re saying for Washington\u2019s they\u2019re saying for Washington\u2019s first player drafted to be a first player drafted to be a d-lineman or an edge rusher is d-lineman or an edge rusher is plus 200. Now, overwhelmingly, plus 200. Now, overwhelmingly, if you were to ask someone, what if you were to ask someone, what does Washington need to do in does Washington need to do in the draft is take a D lineman, the draft is take a D lineman, specifically an edge rusher. But specifically an edge rusher. But you get those juicier odds you get those juicier odds because at 29, where because at 29, where Washington\u2019s currently slated to Washington\u2019s currently slated to pick, who knows who\u2019s going to pick, who knows who\u2019s going to be there? Seriously. I mean, be there? Seriously. I mean, this is a team that has shown this is a team that has shown they go with best player they go with best player available no matter what. available no matter what. They\u2019re going to stick to their They\u2019re going to stick to their draft board. The only position I draft board. The only position I know they won\u2019t take first is know they won\u2019t take first is quarterback. That\u2019s the only one quarterback. That\u2019s the only one you can actually rule out. But you can actually rule out. But if a stud receiver is there a if a stud receiver is there a stud corner, a stud safety, a stud corner, a stud safety, a stud lineman, they may just feel stud lineman, they may just feel they have to go that direction. they have to go that direction. Remember last year they took Remember last year they took Johnny Newton at the top of the Johnny Newton at the top of the second round? That wasn\u2019t the second round? That wasn\u2019t the plan. They just thought they plan. They just thought they were getting first round value were getting first round value at the top of the second round. at the top of the second round. So that\u2019s why that D-lineman So that\u2019s why that D-lineman edge rusher is plus 200. Sure edge rusher is plus 200. Sure seems like they\u2019re going to go seems like they\u2019re going to go that way. But nobody knows for that way. But nobody knows for sure when they\u2019re going to sure when they\u2019re going to draft. Even they could trade out draft. Even they could trade out of 29. What if they trade out of of 29. What if they trade out of 29 to recoup some of the draft 29 to recoup some of the draft picks from the Tunsil trade and picks from the Tunsil trade and even the Tebow trade? Well, then even the Tebow trade? Well, then their first pick might be coming their first pick might be coming at 62. Maybe they trade out of at 62. Maybe they trade out of that one. Their first pick could that one. Their first pick could be 80 for all we know, and be 80 for all we know, and there\u2019s just no way to know there\u2019s just no way to know exactly. That\u2019s why you get the exactly. That\u2019s why you get the juicy odds. Here\u2019s a little juicy odds. Here\u2019s a little update for us. We\u2019ll get to hear update for us. We\u2019ll get to hear from Dan Quinn in not too many from Dan Quinn in not too many weeks. Owners meetings are weeks. Owners meetings are coming up. We will be there. coming up. We will be there.

But we just have a lot of free agents and we have a lot of free agents and we still have a lot of holes to still have a lot of holes to fill on the roster we have. I fill on the roster we have. I think the second least amount of think the second least amount of players on our roster in the players on our roster in the league right now, so we\u2019ll be league right now, so we\u2019ll be busy, but we want to spend, you busy, but we want to spend, you know, on Commanders and spend know, on Commanders and spend the right way. So that\u2019s that\u2019s the right way. So that\u2019s that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to look at it. how we\u2019re going to look at it. How important is it to get a few How important is it to get a few of those deals done before free of those deals done before free agency opens? Some of the guys agency opens? Some of the guys you\u2019ve identified as Commanders you\u2019ve identified as Commanders keep them in house. Yeah, keep them in house. Yeah, certainly you like to do that. certainly you like to do that. And we\u2019re we\u2019re talking with a And we\u2019re we\u2019re talking with a lot of those guys right now. It lot of those guys right now. It just depends on what they want just depends on what they want to do. And if they want to, if to do. And if they want to, if we can come to an agreement we can come to an agreement before free agency, some guys before free agency, some guys want to hit free agency and see want to hit free agency and see what their market is. Some guys what their market is. Some guys want to get stuff done right want to get stuff done right away. The great thing is that away. The great thing is that the culture that DQ created, the culture that DQ created, there\u2019s a lot of guys that want there\u2019s a lot of guys that want to come back, and we\u2019ve had a to come back, and we\u2019ve had a lot of really good conversations lot of really good conversations with that, and so proud of that, with that, and so proud of that, proud of what DQ has created and proud of what DQ has created and having a lot of guys that want having a lot of guys that want to be Commanders going forward. to be Commanders going forward. Tell us which ones want to come Tell us which ones want to come back? No. It\u2019d be great if we back? No. It\u2019d be great if we knew. Unfortunately we don\u2019t. knew. Unfortunately we don\u2019t. You saw the highlights there. You saw the highlights there. Washington has a number of major Washington has a number of major contributors facing free agency contributors facing free agency Jeremy Chinn, Zach Ertz among Jeremy Chinn, Zach Ertz among them. We\u2019ll talk about Bobby them. We\u2019ll talk about Bobby Wagner a little later. Another Wagner a little later. Another guy. But here\u2019s the thing guy. But here\u2019s the thing Washington has so many decisions Washington has so many decisions to make, Adam Peters explained. to make, Adam Peters explained. They like to talk about their They like to talk about their total cash spend instead of just total cash spend instead of just salary cap space. What that salary cap space. What that means is think about how they means is think about how they game up these contracts in pro game up these contracts in pro football. Now, if a player gets football. Now, if a player gets a signing bonus, he generally a signing bonus, he generally gets that money right away. Or gets that money right away. Or perhaps it\u2019s divided up into a perhaps it\u2019s divided up into a couple of lump sum payments. But couple of lump sum payments. But for the salary cap, they\u2019re able for the salary cap, they\u2019re able to divide up that signing bonus to divide up that signing bonus over the years of the contract. over the years of the contract. Well, if you\u2019re actually cutting Well, if you\u2019re actually cutting the check, if you\u2019re Josh Harris the check, if you\u2019re Josh Harris and Mitch Rales, you want to and Mitch Rales, you want to know how much cash you\u2019re know how much cash you\u2019re spending. And that\u2019s what Peters spending. And that\u2019s what Peters was kind of explaining there in was kind of explaining there in the different way that they look the different way that they look at contracts. Here\u2019s another way at contracts. Here\u2019s another way to look at contracts. Jon Allen to look at contracts. Jon Allen is undoubtedly a very good is undoubtedly a very good player for Washington, has been player for Washington, has been for some time. He\u2019s been here for some time. He\u2019s been here long enough. He played for all long enough. He played for all three versions of the team name. three versions of the team name. Well, it sure looks like Jon Well, it sure looks like Jon Allen isn\u2019t going to be here for Allen isn\u2019t going to be here for the 2025 season with Jon. He\u2019s the 2025 season with Jon. He\u2019s another person who\u2019s who\u2019s been another person who\u2019s who\u2019s been a great commander, a great, you a great commander, a great, you know, person for this franchise. know, person for this franchise. And he\u2019s going into the last And he\u2019s going into the last year of his deal and wanted to year of his deal and wanted to give him and his representation. give him and his representation. Blake Baratz, who\u2019s a really Blake Baratz, who\u2019s a really good agent. They just talked good agent. They just talked about it and said wanted to be about it and said wanted to be able to explore opportunities. able to explore opportunities. And so we let them do that and And so we let them do that and we\u2019re staying in contact with we\u2019re staying in contact with them, you know, every day just them, you know, every day just texting with them this morning. texting with them this morning. And, you know, really everything And, you know, really everything is still on the table in terms is still on the table in terms of whether it\u2019s a trade or of whether it\u2019s a trade or staying here or, or whatever. So staying here or, or whatever. So we\u2019re still going through that. we\u2019re still going through that. It\u2019s kind of early in the It\u2019s kind of early in the stages. We haven\u2019t done a lot of stages. We haven\u2019t done a lot of exploring yet, but that\u2019s kind exploring yet, but that\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re at right now. of where we\u2019re at right now. When you\u2019ve got a guy like Jon When you\u2019ve got a guy like Jon Allen and the business of Allen and the business of football is the business of football is the business of football. How are those football. How are those conversations for you as someone conversations for you as someone that really cares about his that really cares about his players? Yeah, and I think what players? Yeah, and I think what I\u2019d like to make sure I\u2019m clear, I\u2019d like to make sure I\u2019m clear, they established it. And so I they established it. And so I get to be a part of it, but it\u2019s get to be a part of it, but it\u2019s theirs. This time of year theirs. This time of year specifically, is when football specifically, is when football and business intersect, and and business intersect, and that\u2019s part of it. It\u2019s part of that\u2019s part of it. It\u2019s part of it for all of us. And so it\u2019s it for all of us. And so it\u2019s not uncomfortable because you not uncomfortable because you want to make sure if you do have want to make sure if you do have relationships, you want to relationships, you want to communicate with people. communicate with people. Players, coaches, all of those Players, coaches, all of those things. But it is this things. But it is this postseason time that those take postseason time that those take place. No team is the same year place. No team is the same year to year. We know that. And so to year. We know that. And so those are always, you know, those are always, you know, decisions regarding team. And decisions regarding team. And you know, how do you do it the you know, how do you do it the best to get the whole thing best to get the whole thing together. And it\u2019s a puzzle and together. And it\u2019s a puzzle and it\u2019s never one thing and how it it\u2019s never one thing and how it goes. And I\u2019m certainly goes. And I\u2019m certainly fortunate with Adam. Like we fortunate with Adam. Like we just talk about the team every just talk about the team every day and how we can do things to day and how we can do things to get better. And so that\u2019s not get better. And so that\u2019s not specific to one player. That\u2019s specific to one player. That\u2019s specific to the whole thing. specific to the whole thing. That was very not specific to That was very not specific to one player. Coach asked about one player. Coach asked about Jon. And I got an answer about Jon. And I got an answer about everybody. Here\u2019s the reality of everybody. Here\u2019s the reality of Jon Allen. If you\u2019re a Jon Allen. If you\u2019re a Commanders fan, if you\u2019re a Commanders fan, if you\u2019re a Burgundy and gold fan, you Burgundy and gold fan, you should really applaud and should really applaud and appreciate all the effort Allen appreciate all the effort Allen put in over the years. But the put in over the years. But the reality of the business of reality of the business of football, I like that line from football, I like that line from DQ when he said, this is the DQ when he said, this is the intersection of football and intersection of football and business. Jon Allen missed a lot business. Jon Allen missed a lot of time last year with that pec of time last year with that pec injury. There\u2019s no guaranteed injury. There\u2019s no guaranteed money left on his deal. He money left on his deal. He probably wants guaranteed money, probably wants guaranteed money, and if that means he gets a new and if that means he gets a new 2 or 3 year deal, whether it\u2019s 2 or 3 year deal, whether it\u2019s in free agency or in a trade, in free agency or in a trade, that that\u2019s probably the that that\u2019s probably the security he\u2019s looking for. And security he\u2019s looking for. And he deserves to go find that, he deserves to go find that, even if it means leaving even if it means leaving Washington. Now, for the folks Washington. Now, for the folks out there that are really out there that are really excited about a potential Jon excited about a potential Jon Allen trade, and maybe it nets Allen trade, and maybe it nets you Myles Garrett or something you Myles Garrett or something crazy. I wouldn\u2019t be so sure. crazy. I wouldn\u2019t be so sure. After talking to a number of After talking to a number of league sources, I think you\u2019re league sources, I think you\u2019re kind of talking about a pick kind of talking about a pick swap like Jon Allen and a fifth. swap like Jon Allen and a fifth. Maybe you get a fourth back. I Maybe you get a fourth back. I don\u2019t think this is going to net don\u2019t think this is going to net a. Certainly not a Thursday a. Certainly not a Thursday night pick. And I don\u2019t even night pick. And I don\u2019t even think a Friday night pick. I think a Friday night pick. I think you\u2019re talking Saturday think you\u2019re talking Saturday draft picks. Maybe that could be draft picks. Maybe that could be moved for somebody else though. moved for somebody else though. We\u2019ll see. Now there\u2019s another We\u2019ll see. Now there\u2019s another big name player that a lot of big name player that a lot of Washington fans want back in Washington fans want back in Burgundy and gold. That would be Burgundy and gold. That would be Bobby Wagner. And certainly Dan Bobby Wagner. And certainly Dan Quinn had plenty to say about Quinn had plenty to say about the veteran linebacker. Bobby the veteran linebacker. Bobby Wagner is somewhere getting Wagner is somewhere getting better today, and I don\u2019t know better today, and I don\u2019t know where it is or what it looks where it is or what it looks like or how he\u2019s doing it, but like or how he\u2019s doing it, but that\u2019s the type of attitude that that\u2019s the type of attitude that we want to chase. Constant we want to chase. Constant improvement, digging for it improvement, digging for it hard, and if and if he can do hard, and if and if he can do it, then everybody else in the it, then everybody else in the organization kind of follow suit organization kind of follow suit into that space. You brought up into that space. You brought up Bobby Wagner, kind of unprompted Bobby Wagner, kind of unprompted at the podium. What does it mean at the podium. What does it mean knowing you\u2019ve got all these knowing you\u2019ve got all these pending free agents and how big pending free agents and how big of an impact they made, like all of an impact they made, like all of the players, when whenever we of the players, when whenever we bring somebody in, whether it\u2019s bring somebody in, whether it\u2019s a drafted player or a free a drafted player or a free agent, this is the role. This is agent, this is the role. This is what I see him doing. And so what I see him doing. And so sometimes you meet him and other sometimes you meet him and other times you even exceed those what times you even exceed those what they can be. And so many guys they can be. And so many guys play these key roles on our play these key roles on our team. You\u2019ve heard the term glue team. You\u2019ve heard the term glue guys and things that can, you guys and things that can, you know, make an impact to others. know, make an impact to others. And there were so many of them. And there were so many of them. But Bobby was certainly one of But Bobby was certainly one of those as a driving factor in those as a driving factor in that. And so he was a really that. And so he was a really important piece to what we did. important piece to what we did. Now, Dan Quinn said repeatedly Now, Dan Quinn said repeatedly that any questions about Bobby that any questions about Bobby Wagner\u2019s future in Washington or Wagner\u2019s future in Washington or elsewhere would have to be elsewhere would have to be referred to Bobby Wagner\u2019s referred to Bobby Wagner\u2019s agent, Dan Quinn, got a kick out agent, Dan Quinn, got a kick out of saying this, and he said it of saying this, and he said it over and over because Bobby over and over because Bobby Wagner acts as his own agent. Wagner acts as his own agent. Now, you know, to now let\u2019s get Now, you know, to now let\u2019s get into some of the other parts into some of the other parts going on around the NFL. I want going on around the NFL. I want to do specifically what they\u2019re to do specifically what they\u2019re saying because there\u2019s so much saying because there\u2019s so much conversation about Myles conversation about Myles Garrett. Can Washington get Garrett. Can Washington get Myles Garrett, can Philly get Myles Garrett, can Philly get Myles Garrett. Well in Cleveland Myles Garrett. Well in Cleveland they don\u2019t think Myles Garrett they don\u2019t think Myles Garrett is going anywhere. You know is going anywhere. You know understand the frustration. understand the frustration. We\u2019ve had plenty of dialog. But We\u2019ve had plenty of dialog. But ultimately my responsibility is ultimately my responsibility is to make the decisions that are to make the decisions that are best for the best for the best for the best for the Browns. And having Myles apart Browns. And having Myles apart of the organization is a huge of the organization is a huge piece of that. And that\u2019s not piece of that. And that\u2019s not unusual. It\u2019s not the first for unusual. It\u2019s not the first for us. It won\u2019t be the probably us. It won\u2019t be the probably won\u2019t be the last. It\u2019s not the won\u2019t be the last. It\u2019s not the first across the league. But we first across the league. But we respect we appreciate Myles. And respect we appreciate Myles. And you know like I said we\u2019re not you know like I said we\u2019re not we\u2019re not interested in moving we\u2019re not interested in moving him. So they\u2019re not interested him. So they\u2019re not interested in moving him. Well they might in moving him. Well they might not have a choice depending how not have a choice depending how much Garrett wants to cause some much Garrett wants to cause some trouble this offseason, he could trouble this offseason, he could probably force his way out. Both probably force his way out. Both Barry, the general manager, and Barry, the general manager, and Kevin Stefanski, the Browns head Kevin Stefanski, the Browns head coach, said Garrett\u2019s not going coach, said Garrett\u2019s not going anywhere. That\u2019s not part of our anywhere. That\u2019s not part of our plan. Plans change in the NFL. I plan. Plans change in the NFL. I don\u2019t think anything happens don\u2019t think anything happens with Garrett until closer to the with Garrett until closer to the draft. You\u2019d have to work out a draft. You\u2019d have to work out a contract. There\u2019s a whole lot of contract. There\u2019s a whole lot of guaranteed money involved, but guaranteed money involved, but I\u2019m not so convinced. Myles I\u2019m not so convinced. Myles Garrett is definitely staying in Garrett is definitely staying in Cleveland, despite what the Cleveland, despite what the brass there might be saying. brass there might be saying. Now, I do want to make time for Now, I do want to make time for what you missed. This is an what you missed. This is an important one because we important one because we hammered the organization when hammered the organization when they got the bad grades on these they got the bad grades on these NFLPA report cards. Well, you NFLPA report cards. Well, you know what? Now the grades are know what? Now the grades are good. They\u2019ve moved way up. And good. They\u2019ve moved way up. And here\u2019s Dan Quinn talking about here\u2019s Dan Quinn talking about the improvements for Washington. the improvements for Washington. They have gone way up here. And They have gone way up here. And DQ supports ownership support of DQ supports ownership support of his team. I thought the first his team. I thought the first thing I thought of, I was thing I thought of, I was pleased to see treatment of pleased to see treatment of families. And that goes to Josh, families. And that goes to Josh, honestly. And Adam, there\u2019s not honestly. And Adam, there\u2019s not a there\u2019s no gap in between what a there\u2019s no gap in between what he says and what he does. And so he says and what he does. And so to have that type of reflection to have that type of reflection in a year is really big. We told in a year is really big. We told him how important this was to him how important this was to us. He heard that from the us. He heard that from the players and then took action on players and then took action on that. And I think that\u2019s that. And I think that\u2019s honestly like what that honestly like what that relationship has been for us. relationship has been for us. What do you need to win and how What do you need to win and how do we go about and do that? And do we go about and do that? And so to see things like family so to see things like family support and having that support and having that increase, that\u2019s really big. The increase, that\u2019s really big. The families, our families, players, families, our families, players, coaches, the organization, they coaches, the organization, they make a lot of sacrifices for us make a lot of sacrifices for us to do what we can do. And so to to do what we can do. And so to have that right there, team have that right there, team travel, all those to me, just travel, all those to me, just reflect back to Josh and the reflect back to Josh and the vision of what it can be. And I vision of what it can be. And I couldn\u2019t be more proud to be a couldn\u2019t be more proud to be a part of it. You see Josh Harris part of it. You see Josh Harris there with his brother Gabe there with his brother Gabe talking about family being talking about family being important. Josh Harris famously important. Josh Harris famously said, I\u2019m not an f minus guy. We said, I\u2019m not an f minus guy. We will improve this and look will improve this and look across the board. F minus to B+ across the board. F minus to B+ for treatment of families. That for treatment of families. That really drives the bus. Nobody, really drives the bus. Nobody, nobody likes to go to work and nobody likes to go to work and then come home and their wife is then come home and their wife is mad about something. If you mad about something. If you start taking care of the start taking care of the families, that makes everything families, that makes everything go better. Look at Team Travel f go better. Look at Team Travel f two and a look at head coach Dan two and a look at head coach Dan Quinn was voted the best coach Quinn was voted the best coach in this NFLPA poll. This really in this NFLPA poll. This really says a lot about Ownership\u2019s says a lot about Ownership\u2019s commitment to winning. You have commitment to winning. You have an organization that is serious an organization that is serious about chasing a championship. about chasing a championship. Commanders fans that\u2019s got to Commanders fans that\u2019s got to feel good to hear. We got plenty feel good to hear. We got plenty more from Indy when we return. the opportunity to serve. That\u2019s what working for you is. This is what working for you is. This is All Ears with JP Finlay. We are All Ears with JP Finlay. We are back. It\u2019s all ears. Live on back. It\u2019s all ears. Live on location. Indianapolis, Indiana. location. Indianapolis, Indiana. At the NFL Scouting combine. At the NFL Scouting combine. They say next is here. Well, so They say next is here. Well, so are we. So far in the show, are we. So far in the show, you\u2019ve heard from Dan Quinn and you\u2019ve heard from Dan Quinn and Adam Peters, as well as Browns Adam Peters, as well as Browns general manager Andrew Berry. general manager Andrew Berry. Let\u2019s check in with the Let\u2019s check in with the defending Super Bowl champions defending Super Bowl champions Howie Roseman and how the New Howie Roseman and how the New Jersey native GM of the Eagles Jersey native GM of the Eagles that just won a Super Bowl. Oh, that just won a Super Bowl. Oh, by the way, his second. How he by the way, his second. How he likes to build a team. Never likes to build a team. Never feel like we can. We have enough feel like we can. We have enough linemen or linemen always on the linemen or linemen always on the lookout for those positions at lookout for those positions at every level, whether it\u2019s in every level, whether it\u2019s in free agency, whether it\u2019s in the free agency, whether it\u2019s in the draft, whether it\u2019s after the draft, whether it\u2019s after the draft, whether it\u2019s on the draft, whether it\u2019s on the street, it\u2019s really like an street, it\u2019s really like an unhealthy obsession, Zach, to be unhealthy obsession, Zach, to be honest with you. And so I\u2019m honest with you. And so I\u2019m never feel good enough because I never feel good enough because I can convince myself, you know, I can convince myself, you know, I can go back and watch a game can go back and watch a game from this year and see that we from this year and see that we were down three offensive were down three offensive linemen, you know, and then I\u2019m linemen, you know, and then I\u2019m going, well, now we need eight going, well, now we need eight starters, you know. And so it\u2019s starters, you know. And so it\u2019s the same with the D line I think the same with the D line I think that those are incredibly that those are incredibly important positions. And you important positions. And you know you can never have enough know you can never have enough of them. An unhealthy obsession of them. An unhealthy obsession with the offensive and defensive with the offensive and defensive lines. And if you look at how lines. And if you look at how Philly beats teams that\u2019s how Philly beats teams that\u2019s how they do it. They are stronger at they do it. They are stronger at the point of attack, at the line the point of attack, at the line of scrimmage, game after game, of scrimmage, game after game, week after week. And that\u2019s what week after week. And that\u2019s what won them the Super Bowl. Go back won them the Super Bowl. Go back and watch that. Patrick Mahomes and watch that. Patrick Mahomes was under duress the entire was under duress the entire game. Meanwhile, Jalen Hurts had game. Meanwhile, Jalen Hurts had all the time in the world. The all the time in the world. The Philadelphia model is similar to Philadelphia model is similar to what Joe Gibbs model was, going what Joe Gibbs model was, going back to the Washington glory back to the Washington glory days of the 80s and 90s. It\u2019s days of the 80s and 90s. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s unusual to want to not that it\u2019s unusual to want to build from the inside out, it\u2019s build from the inside out, it\u2019s just how good Philly has been at just how good Philly has been at it. And here\u2019s the biggest it. And here\u2019s the biggest problem for Washington. Sure, problem for Washington. Sure, the whole NFL is now chasing the the whole NFL is now chasing the Eagles. They are the Super Bowl Eagles. They are the Super Bowl champions. But Washington\u2019s got champions. But Washington\u2019s got to deal with them in the to deal with them in the division. So what does that mean division. So what does that mean for Dan Quinn as he looks to in for Dan Quinn as he looks to in his second season. Continue to his second season. Continue to build up the Commanders. It\u2019s build up the Commanders. It\u2019s probably bigger than like this probably bigger than like this specific thing. But what at the specific thing. But what at the very front of the line man, are very front of the line man, are we looking for like the we looking for like the competitive spirit in a player competitive spirit in a player and guys who just absolutely and guys who just absolutely love ball? They\u2019re willing to love ball? They\u2019re willing to show that connection to their show that connection to their teammates. And some of that teammates. And some of that shows up in meetings like it shows up in meetings like it does here about leadership, does here about leadership, about tell me some examples. The about tell me some examples. The tape and that part of the tape and that part of the evaluation that\u2019s clear. But we evaluation that\u2019s clear. But we also want to go full circle and also want to go full circle and make sure it\u2019s so important that make sure it\u2019s so important that the people that we bring in to the people that we bring in to this crew are going to be part this crew are going to be part of an outstanding group, and we of an outstanding group, and we want to make sure every single want to make sure every single thought we can do to add to thought we can do to add to that, we will. And so that\u2019s that, we will. And so that\u2019s much clearer to be able to see much clearer to be able to see that on full display going into that on full display going into this year. It\u2019s obvious that this year. It\u2019s obvious that Peters and Quinn like to build Peters and Quinn like to build this team with guys full of high this team with guys full of high character. I mean, if you go character. I mean, if you go back and look at last year, they back and look at last year, they drafted a number of guys that drafted a number of guys that were captains of their college were captains of their college teams. That is obviously the teams. That is obviously the goal. So is big, strong, goal. So is big, strong, violent. DQ explained that. But violent. DQ explained that. But you know what makes a lot of you know what makes a lot of this easier for Washington? I\u2019m this easier for Washington? I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s easy, but what not saying it\u2019s easy, but what makes it easier having a makes it easier having a quarterback like Jayden Daniels quarterback like Jayden Daniels for so many years, Washington for so many years, Washington was lost in the quarterback was lost in the quarterback abyss. It feels like most of my abyss. It feels like most of my life, Washington was lost in the life, Washington was lost in the quarterback abyss. They have now quarterback abyss.

Thank you, Bill, for the long winded Bill, for the long winded question. Now let\u2019s talk about question. Now let\u2019s talk about this because Dan Quinn got asked this because Dan Quinn got asked and Adam Peters got asked about and Adam Peters got asked about is there any roster flexibility, is there any roster flexibility, position flexibility position flexibility specifically with a guy like specifically with a guy like Brandon Coleman? When Coleman Brandon Coleman? When Coleman was drafted, a lot of NFL was drafted, a lot of NFL experts thought he was going to experts thought he was going to be a guard after the draft pick. be a guard after the draft pick. I heard from folks in Ashburn I heard from folks in Ashburn the following day, he\u2019s a the following day, he\u2019s a tackle. Just watch if you watch tackle. Just watch if you watch Coleman. Over the course of the Coleman. Over the course of the season, a rookie playing left season, a rookie playing left tackle for the majority of the tackle for the majority of the games, he was very good in run games, he was very good in run pass Pro could use some work, pass Pro could use some work, especially late in the year, but especially late in the year, but he had that rookie wall working he had that rookie wall working and he was just beat up. and he was just beat up. Everybody seems to struggle Everybody seems to struggle against the Philly D line now. against the Philly D line now. When DQ got asked, said we\u2019re When DQ got asked, said we\u2019re going to watch with fresh eyes. going to watch with fresh eyes. Now, what that means is if Now, what that means is if there\u2019s another guy that can there\u2019s another guy that can play tackle really well, maybe play tackle really well, maybe we do bump Coleman inside, but we do bump Coleman inside, but they don\u2019t feel there\u2019s a need they don\u2019t feel there\u2019s a need to start moving pieces around to start moving pieces around the Cosby injury. Certainly that the Cosby injury. Certainly that impacts this thing because impacts this thing because you\u2019re not sure Cosby got hurt you\u2019re not sure Cosby got hurt in January. Saints a 910 month in January. Saints a 910 month recovery. You\u2019re probably recovery. You\u2019re probably talking around Halloween it talking around Halloween it we\u2019re just going to have to we\u2019re just going to have to monitor how that injury goes. monitor how that injury goes. Adam Peters did say Sam Cosby\u2019s Adam Peters did say Sam Cosby\u2019s already back in the team\u2019s already back in the team\u2019s Ashburn facilities, working on Ashburn facilities, working on his rehab from the knee injury. his rehab from the knee injury. There\u2019s going to be some moving There\u2019s going to be some moving parts. It\u2019s the offensive line. parts. It\u2019s the offensive line. They always are. I think that\u2019s They always are. I think that\u2019s why offensive linemen in free why offensive linemen in free agency and in the draft are agency and in the draft are going to be a huge focus for going to be a huge focus for this Washington front office. this Washington front office. All right. Question number two. All right. Question number two. What do you got? I\u2019ll try to What do you got? I\u2019ll try to read the whole thing this time. read the whole thing this time. Jay Daniels MVP says do you see Jay Daniels MVP says do you see the Commanders trading Allen for the Commanders trading Allen for Deebo or Kupp. I\u2019m assuming Deebo or Kupp. I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s the full question. This that\u2019s the full question. This is really fascinating. I don\u2019t is really fascinating. I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s going to be a know that there\u2019s going to be a direct player for player swap in direct player for player swap in this kind of thing, because all this kind of thing, because all of the players involved want new of the players involved want new contracts, so they want to be contracts, so they want to be able to negotiate those deals able to negotiate those deals all over the place. I will say all over the place. I will say this, I think if you\u2019re trading this, I think if you\u2019re trading John Allen and it ends up being John Allen and it ends up being a pick swap, say a fifth and a pick swap, say a fifth and John Allen becomes a fourth, I John Allen becomes a fourth, I think you could get Deebo Samuel think you could get Deebo Samuel or maybe even Cooper Kupp for or maybe even Cooper Kupp for about that, because really what about that, because really what the what the Niners and the Rams the what the Niners and the Rams respectively are trying to do is respectively are trying to do is kind of just control that salary kind of just control that salary and move it off their books. And and move it off their books. And I think Deebo in particular, Dan I think Deebo in particular, Dan Quinn, was asked about what kind Quinn, was asked about what kind of things he\u2019s looking for in of things he\u2019s looking for in skill, position players. He said skill, position players. He said violent and they attack their violent and they attack their cuts. Is there a more violent cuts. Is there a more violent wide receiver in the NFL than wide receiver in the NFL than Deebo Samuel? He\u2019s he\u2019s Deebo Samuel? He\u2019s he\u2019s certainly among the top five. So certainly among the top five. So that\u2019s one to watch. Obviously that\u2019s one to watch. Obviously he has deep ties with Adam he has deep ties with Adam Peters as well. Question numero Peters as well. Question numero trace. Let\u2019s do this. What do we trace. Let\u2019s do this. What do we got. Just your average fly guy. got. Just your average fly guy. Alright. If you had to guess, Alright. If you had to guess, are we picking Ebuka at 29, the are we picking Ebuka at 29, the Ohio State wide receiver. I Ohio State wide receiver. I think that\u2019s possible. I think think that\u2019s possible. I think wide outs there. I think pass wide outs there. I think pass rusher remains a really high rusher remains a really high priority for this team. But at priority for this team. But at 29 it\u2019s best player available. 29 it\u2019s best player available. What if Omarion Hampton slips. What if Omarion Hampton slips. Everybody thinks he goes top 15. Everybody thinks he goes top 15. What if he slips. What if What if he slips. What if there\u2019s an early run on corners there\u2019s an early run on corners and you get some of these stud and you get some of these stud interior D lineman at 29, it\u2019s interior D lineman at 29, it\u2019s purely best player available. purely best player available. The only person you\u2019re not The only person you\u2019re not drafting at 29 is a quarterback. drafting at 29 is a quarterback. Let\u2019s get to our last question Let\u2019s get to our last question of the evening. Of course we do of the evening. Of course we do the mailbag every week if you the mailbag every week if you want to be a part of it. Why? want to be a part of it. Why? This is specific to me. Why are This is specific to me. Why are you against the tush? Push. Let you against the tush? Push. Let me be clear on this. I\u2019m not me be clear on this. I\u2019m not against the tush. Push. I think against the tush. Push. I think the Eagles just run a really, the Eagles just run a really, really good version of it. What really good version of it. What I am against is a rule that the I am against is a rule that the NFL changed in 2006. That a NFL changed in 2006. That a runner, a ball carrier, whether runner, a ball carrier, whether it\u2019s a wide receiver or a tight it\u2019s a wide receiver or a tight end, a running back, or in this end, a running back, or in this case, a quarterback in prior to case, a quarterback in prior to 2006, it was illegal to push the 2006, it was illegal to push the ball carrier from behind. I ball carrier from behind. I think that rule should be think that rule should be reinstituted. I think that is reinstituted. I think that is where the danger occurs. And where the danger occurs. And think about how often you see a think about how often you see a running back or a receiver kind running back or a receiver kind of get boggled up in a pile of get boggled up in a pile inside the five, and an inside the five, and an offensive lineman comes running offensive lineman comes running from 20 yards away and blows up from 20 yards away and blows up that pile to try to get that guy that pile to try to get that guy into the end zone. That is into the end zone. That is legitimately dangerous. And if legitimately dangerous. And if the focus is on player safety, I the focus is on player safety, I think that rule change, I think think that rule change, I think you got to reinstitute that. you got to reinstitute that. They can\u2019t be pushed from They can\u2019t be pushed from behind. And I think that will behind. And I think that will have significant impact on the have significant impact on the tush push. Nobody go anywhere. serve. That\u2019s what working for you is. Welcome back to All you is. Welcome back to All Ears, the Indy edition. We are Ears, the Indy edition. We are at the NFL Scouting Combine with at the NFL Scouting Combine with the Commanders brass and brass the Commanders brass and brass from all over the NFL. And why? from all over the NFL. And why?

And if anybody starts telling you they know starts telling you they know they\u2019re they\u2019re lying to you. they\u2019re they\u2019re lying to you. Let me be clear. But what about Let me be clear. But what about at the top of this draft? It\u2019s at the top of this draft? It\u2019s pretty darn interesting. Here\u2019s pretty darn interesting. Here\u2019s the weekend line who\u2019s going to the weekend line who\u2019s going to be the top pick? And of course, be the top pick? And of course, you got a quarterback at Cam you got a quarterback at Cam Ward Madden and Abdul Carter. Ward Madden and Abdul Carter. And then just an overall athlete And then just an overall athlete stud, wide receiver, cornerback stud, wide receiver, cornerback Travis Hunter, the Heisman Travis Hunter, the Heisman Trophy winner out of Colorado. Trophy winner out of Colorado. For me, it\u2019s going to be really For me, it\u2019s going to be really fascinating to see what actually fascinating to see what actually happens here. I think Abdul happens here. I think Abdul Carter is the best player in Carter is the best player in this draft, the way he played in this draft, the way he played in the College Football Playoff for the College Football Playoff for those Penn State teams, and he those Penn State teams, and he was injured. He was dominant. was injured. He was dominant. Travis Hunter is an incredible Travis Hunter is an incredible athlete. I think you play him as athlete. I think you play him as a corner and then build out a corner and then build out packages for him as a wideout. packages for him as a wideout. But you know what always gets But you know what always gets over drafted quarterback I think over drafted quarterback I think Cam Ward\u2019s the best one in this Cam Ward\u2019s the best one in this class.

And I think because Garrett\u2019s contract because Garrett\u2019s contract situation is highly complicated situation is highly complicated and the compensation to get and the compensation to get Garrett out of Cleveland also Garrett out of Cleveland also highly complicated. I don\u2019t know highly complicated. I don\u2019t know that anything actually moves on that anything actually moves on that until closer to the NFL. that until closer to the NFL. Draft deadlines drive deals, as Draft deadlines drive deals, as they say in the NFL, and a trade they say in the NFL, and a trade for Garrett is going to be for Garrett is going to be driven by picks, primarily first driven by picks, primarily first round picks. Washington picking round picks. Washington picking at 29 and ideally with Jayden at 29 and ideally with Jayden Daniels as your quarterback, Daniels as your quarterback, picking deep into the 20s for picking deep into the 20s for the next foreseeable years. the next foreseeable years. Maybe you really do make a move Maybe you really do make a move for Garrett, but don\u2019t hold your for Garrett, but don\u2019t hold your breath. That\u2019s going to be a breath. That\u2019s going to be a slow developing situation with slow developing situation with Myles Garrett. Here\u2019s another Myles Garrett. Here\u2019s another thing that is really going to be thing that is really going to be fascinating. It\u2019s the San fascinating. It\u2019s the San Francisco 49 ers quarterback Francisco 49 ers quarterback situation. Let\u2019s get to what situation. Let\u2019s get to what they\u2019re saying because this is they\u2019re saying because this is one of the all time greats Joe one of the all time greats Joe Montana saying what the Niners Montana saying what the Niners should do about Brock Purdy. should do about Brock Purdy. What do you think the Niners What do you think the Niners should do with Brock Purdy. Oh should do with Brock Purdy. Oh you got to pay him I mean, I can you got to pay him I mean, I can show you 4 or 5 guys in the show you 4 or 5 guys in the league making tons of money that league making tons of money that haven\u2019t produced anywhere near haven\u2019t produced anywhere near what he\u2019s been able to do. And what he\u2019s been able to do. And they just had one of those years they just had one of those years where guys are getting hurt where guys are getting hurt offensively, defensively. offensively, defensively. Craziness in the beginning of Craziness in the beginning of the year with, you know, the the year with, you know, the trade talk and trades with the trade talk and trades with the wide receiver. And then he gets wide receiver. And then he gets hurt. They just they just had hurt. They just they just had one of those years. You just one of those years. You just can\u2019t wait to get behind you. can\u2019t wait to get behind you. Yeah just chalk it up yeah. To Yeah just chalk it up yeah. To that move on. But you think that move on. But you think Purdy is the quarterback of the Purdy is the quarterback of the future. And yeah I think he he\u2019s future. And yeah I think he he\u2019s got a good understanding. I got a good understanding. I think one of the things I think one of the things I thought they pressed a little thought they pressed a little bit towards the end every time bit towards the end every time they got behind. So you saw they got behind. So you saw Purdy get sacked more times. Purdy get sacked more times. First of all you got you got First of all you got you got some offensive linemen who are some offensive linemen who are hurt. And so now you\u2019re making hurt. And so now you\u2019re making him hold the ball longer. And him hold the ball longer. And sometimes I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s sometimes I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s only on TV that I can see. And only on TV that I can see. And which I hate to make that which I hate to make that judgment, but when the guy gets judgment, but when the guy gets sacked and I can\u2019t see a wide sacked and I can\u2019t see a wide receiver or any receiver on the receiver or any receiver on the screen there, it looks like screen there, it looks like they\u2019re trying to push the ball they\u2019re trying to push the ball down the field. And that\u2019s not down the field. And that\u2019s not what that\u2019s not what they do. what that\u2019s not what they do. That\u2019s not typically what they That\u2019s not typically what they do. Checking the right wrist. do. Checking the right wrist. Few people as qualified to talk Few people as qualified to talk about San Francisco quarterbacks about San Francisco quarterbacks as Joe Montana before Tom Brady, as Joe Montana before Tom Brady, and before Patrick Mahomes and before Patrick Mahomes started fighting over who the started fighting over who the goat was, it was Montana that goat was, it was Montana that said, you\u2019re going to pay Brock said, you\u2019re going to pay Brock Purdy $60 million, $60 million. Purdy $60 million, $60 million. I don\u2019t think Purdy should be I don\u2019t think Purdy should be judged on his previous draft judged on his previous draft status. Go back. He was Mr. status. Go back. He was Mr. Irrelevant, the last pick of Irrelevant, the last pick of that draft. But he\u2019s really that draft. But he\u2019s really good. But man, that is a lot of good. But man, that is a lot of money to commit to the money to commit to the quarterback position. They got a quarterback position. They got a lot of talent out there in San lot of talent out there in San Francisco. Go back a year. They Francisco. Go back a year. They were a Super Bowl favorite this were a Super Bowl favorite this past year. They missed the past year. They missed the playoffs entirely. It\u2019s playoffs entirely. It\u2019s fascinating to think about fascinating to think about what\u2019s going to happen in San what\u2019s going to happen in San Francisco, where there\u2019s going Francisco, where there\u2019s going to be a lot of moving parts to be a lot of moving parts before the new NFL league year before the new NFL league year opens in the middle of March, opens in the middle of March, and you got to wonder, Adam and you got to wonder, Adam Peters has ties to that Niners Peters has ties to that Niners organization. Now. They\u2019re not organization. Now. They\u2019re not looking at quarterback, but all looking at quarterback, but all over the rest of that roster over the rest of that roster they\u2019re going to be paying they\u2019re going to be paying attention. What about some attention. What about some linebackers that Adam Peters linebackers that Adam Peters knows a thing or two about Dre knows a thing or two about Dre Greenlaw I mean there\u2019s going to Greenlaw I mean there\u2019s going to be a lot of moving parts based be a lot of moving parts based on Purdy getting paid. And on Purdy getting paid. And certainly a big one of them is certainly a big one of them is going to be Deebo Samuel. Deebo going to be Deebo Samuel. Deebo has requested a trade. The has requested a trade. The Niners have said if you can Niners have said if you can figure it out go get it. Here\u2019s figure it out go get it. Here\u2019s Deebo what you missed talking Deebo what you missed talking about where he might end up. about where he might end up. Who\u2019s a team in your opinion Who\u2019s a team in your opinion that people should kind of be that people should kind of be like ooh they might be they like ooh they might be they might be something special. I might be something special. I can say Denver is playing can say Denver is playing really, really good ball right really, really good ball right now. Your defense is outrageous. now. Your defense is outrageous. You got P2 out there. Who\u2019s I You got P2 out there. Who\u2019s I would say the best at the would say the best at the position right now. Probably position right now. Probably been for the past two years. You been for the past two years. You got the other guy on the other got the other guy on the other side. I just think you need a side. I just think you need a couple more pieces and then couple more pieces and then it\u2019ll be what it need to be and it\u2019ll be what it need to be and just have to get past Pat just have to get past Pat Mahomes every year. So that\u2019s Mahomes every year. So that\u2019s Debo talking about Denver. But Debo talking about Denver. But let\u2019s be crystal clear. Debo is let\u2019s be crystal clear. Debo is going to go wherever he gets going to go wherever he gets paid. He\u2019s currently got no paid. He\u2019s currently got no guaranteed money. In the last guaranteed money. In the last year of his deal in San Fran. year of his deal in San Fran. He\u2019s going to look for He\u2019s going to look for opportunity and cash. Washington opportunity and cash. Washington could be one of those teams. could be one of those teams. Certainly. Peters knows Debo Certainly. Peters knows Debo from their time in San Fran. from their time in San Fran. There\u2019s going to be so many There\u2019s going to be so many moving parts. I kind of wanted moving parts. I kind of wanted to pick a few different ones. to pick a few different ones. Just to give you a sense of how Just to give you a sense of how crazy this NFL offseason is crazy this NFL offseason is going to be. And here\u2019s one going to be. And here\u2019s one thing we know about Adam Peters. thing we know about Adam Peters. When he took the job in When he took the job in Washington, he said he wants to Washington, he said he wants to be in on every conversation. be in on every conversation. Doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s going to do Doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s going to do it, but he at least wants to it, but he at least wants to know what the conversation is know what the conversation is about. Now, as we get close to about. Now, as we get close to free agency here, Peters has a free agency here, Peters has a lot of decisions to make. lot of decisions to make. Washington has more than 20 Washington has more than 20 players with expiring contracts. players with expiring contracts. It\u2019s all going to start here It\u2019s all going to start here very, very shortly. So you got very, very shortly. So you got to wonder who are some of the to wonder who are some of the guys Washington has to keep. guys Washington has to keep. Look at this list of players. Look at this list of players. All these contracts expire in All these contracts expire in the middle of March. They\u2019re the middle of March. They\u2019re going to have to figure some going to have to figure some stuff out just to keep a roster stuff out just to keep a roster going. Let\u2019s take a look at some going. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the players I think are most of the players I think are most important for Washington. Let\u2019s important for Washington. Let\u2019s start with Jeremy Chinn. You\u2019re start with Jeremy Chinn. You\u2019re talking about a safety who was talking about a safety who was really good for this Commanders really good for this Commanders defense this year, second in defense this year, second in tackles on the season and just a tackles on the season and just a ferocious downhill player was ferocious downhill player was able to generate some turnovers. able to generate some turnovers. Chinn is the kind of player Chinn is the kind of player because he\u2019s a little bit because he\u2019s a little bit younger. He\u2019s only 27. Maybe younger. He\u2019s only 27. Maybe that\u2019s the guy that gets a that\u2019s the guy that gets a multiyear deal. A lot of these multiyear deal. A lot of these veteran players Washington veteran players Washington signed last offseason, they signed last offseason, they might be looking at another one might be looking at another one year deal. But Chinn, I think year deal. But Chinn, I think you can give him some guaranteed you can give him some guaranteed money into a second season. money into a second season. Great locker room guy. I think Great locker room guy. I think Chinn is somebody they might Chinn is somebody they might prioritize. It\u2019s going to be prioritize. It\u2019s going to be interesting to watch that unfold interesting to watch that unfold because I think he\u2019s around a because I think he\u2019s around a seven, eight, seven, 8 million a seven, eight, seven, 8 million a year guy. Maybe that gets up to year guy. Maybe that gets up to ten. That gets a little too ten. That gets a little too expensive. Now let\u2019s talk about expensive. Now let\u2019s talk about the guy that was the leader of the guy that was the leader of Washington\u2019s defense that is Washington\u2019s defense that is headed for free agency. Bobby headed for free agency. Bobby Wagner, take a look at Wagner. Wagner, take a look at Wagner. Everybody knows he\u2019s a Everybody knows he\u2019s a linebacker. He\u2019s the team linebacker. He\u2019s the team captain type. He had 132 tackles captain type. He had 132 tackles last year. 132 tackles is pretty last year. 132 tackles is pretty darn significant. He played on darn significant. He played on 99% of the snaps for 99% of the snaps for Washington\u2019s defense at age 35. Washington\u2019s defense at age 35. Think about that. Think about Think about that. Think about the longevity of his career. the longevity of his career. Think about the leadership, his Think about the leadership, his relationship with Jayden relationship with Jayden Daniels. I see it in the locker Daniels. I see it in the locker room every day. Those two are room every day. Those two are close. They\u2019re both Southern close. They\u2019re both Southern California guys. They love to California guys. They love to talk about the Lakers and just talk about the Lakers and just trash talk about who could beat trash talk about who could beat who in basketball. I don\u2019t know who in basketball. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve ever played Wagner. I if they\u2019ve ever played Wagner. I don\u2019t know what the money looks don\u2019t know what the money looks like. And I do wonder if Pete like. And I do wonder if Pete Carroll coaching the Raiders is Carroll coaching the Raiders is not going to go after a guy like not going to go after a guy like Wagner, but Wagner is a guy Wagner, but Wagner is a guy you\u2019d like to keep in your you\u2019d like to keep in your building, undoubtedly. Now there building, undoubtedly. Now there are others though, and that\u2019s are others though, and that\u2019s where this is going to get so where this is going to get so complicated. Think about a guy complicated. Think about a guy like Zach Ertz, tight end that like Zach Ertz, tight end that really emerged as an emergency really emerged as an emergency blanket for Jaden. And then just blanket for Jaden. And then just over the course of the season over the course of the season into the playoffs was fantastic. into the playoffs was fantastic. 654 yards, seven touchdowns in 654 yards, seven touchdowns in the regular season. Yes he\u2019s 35. the regular season. Yes he\u2019s 35. But at some point if guys prove But at some point if guys prove they can play on the field, you they can play on the field, you got to bring them back. I don\u2019t got to bring them back. I don\u2019t know what the decision is there know what the decision is there with Ertz. Remember they just with Ertz. Remember they just drafted Ben Senate. Maybe they drafted Ben Senate. Maybe they think he can take a real step think he can take a real step forward be a tight end that can forward be a tight end that can make an offensive dent. He make an offensive dent. He really didn\u2019t do that this past really didn\u2019t do that this past season. Ertz though was a great season. Ertz though was a great guy in that locker room and guy in that locker room and really, really delivered. And really, really delivered. And keep in mind Ertz and offensive keep in mind Ertz and offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury that coordinator Kliff Kingsbury that elected to stay in Washington. elected to stay in Washington. Those two are tight, so I won\u2019t Those two are tight, so I won\u2019t be shocked if Ertz is back. Now be shocked if Ertz is back. Now this one perhaps it\u2019s a little this one perhaps it\u2019s a little personal. There is no way you personal. There is no way you let our guy tress way go. let our guy tress way go. There\u2019s just you can\u2019t do it. There\u2019s just you can\u2019t do it. Trust we must stay here. It\u2019s Trust we must stay here. It\u2019s simple. The people have spoken. simple. The people have spoken. Trust is the people\u2019s punter. Trust is the people\u2019s punter. You want some stats? He\u2019s the You want some stats? He\u2019s the franchise leader in punt yards franchise leader in punt yards and yards per punt all around. and yards per punt all around. Good dude. And I think the Good dude. And I think the people of the DMV would riot if people of the DMV would riot if they saw tress way in another they saw tress way in another uniform. Bring back tress. uniform. Bring back tress. That\u2019s an easy one. Now, we did That\u2019s an easy one. Now, we did post this on my Facebook page, post this on my Facebook page, and we got a bunch of people and we got a bunch of people commenting about what guys they commenting about what guys they want to bring in. Let\u2019s take a want to bring in. Let\u2019s take a look at what some of the folks look at what some of the folks were saying to me. Dan Brown I were saying to me. Dan Brown I don\u2019t mind this one. He said. don\u2019t mind this one. He said. Chin Bobby Wagner Dyami Brown. Chin Bobby Wagner Dyami Brown. They are going to have to sign They are going to have to sign some wide outs here because they some wide outs here because they only have two under contract for only have two under contract for next year. Terry McLaurin and next year. Terry McLaurin and Luke McCaffrey. You really hope Luke McCaffrey. You really hope Luke can make a big jump in year Luke can make a big jump in year two. That will remain to get two. That will remain to get seen, but you\u2019re going to have seen, but you\u2019re going to have to bring more wideouts in. My to bring more wideouts in. My guy Bill Hunsberger I don\u2019t guy Bill Hunsberger I don\u2019t agree with you. Bill Hunsberger agree with you.

I do wonder if at free agency. I do wonder if at the receiver position, they\u2019re the receiver position, they\u2019re not looking, maybe even in the not looking, maybe even in the division. Darius Slayton is a division. Darius Slayton is a guy from the Giants that\u2019s guy from the Giants that\u2019s probably going to be on that probably going to be on that tier two, tier three pricing. tier two, tier three pricing. Look, go down to Jacksonville. Look, go down to Jacksonville.

You know Kirk got the big contract know Kirk got the big contract from the Jags delivered early from the Jags delivered early then dealt with some injuries. I then dealt with some injuries. I do think that\u2019s kind of where do think that\u2019s kind of where you\u2019re going to be shopping. you\u2019re going to be shopping. Look at some of those Cowboys Look at some of those Cowboys defensive players that might be defensive players that might be hitting free agency this year. hitting free agency this year. You know DQ Joe Whitt are going You know DQ Joe Whitt are going to have a good idea of kind of to have a good idea of kind of who what they are on the field who what they are on the field and if they could fit in to this and if they could fit in to this Commanders locker room. It\u2019s Commanders locker room. It\u2019s going to be fun. And the names going to be fun. And the names are going to be coming from all are going to be coming from all over the league, and we\u2019ll start over the league, and we\u2019ll start to get a better idea next week to get a better idea next week in Indy. Let\u2019s get to our next in Indy. Let\u2019s get to our next question here. As everybody is question here. As everybody is gearing up for free agency. Man, gearing up for free agency. Man, this one says I believe we\u2019re this one says I believe we\u2019re going to Brazil. Thoughts? This going to Brazil. Thoughts? This is from someone with the handle is from someone with the handle of Jesus of Nazareth. That seems of Jesus of Nazareth. That seems fairly audacious to make that fairly audacious to make that your Twitter handle, but it\u2019s your Twitter handle, but it\u2019s not up to me. I think it\u2019s not up to me. I think it\u2019s possible. Here\u2019s what we know. possible. Here\u2019s what we know. The LA Chargers are going to The LA Chargers are going to play week one in Brazil, and play week one in Brazil, and it\u2019s going to be a Chargers home it\u2019s going to be a Chargers home game. That game will be Friday game. That game will be Friday night. The Eagles get the home night. The Eagles get the home opener Thursday night, then the opener Thursday night, then the Chargers in Brazil Friday night. Chargers in Brazil Friday night. What I know is Washington plays What I know is Washington plays at Philly next season and at the at Philly next season and at the Chargers. So the Chargers have Chargers. So the Chargers have made the Brazil game their home made the Brazil game their home game. It\u2019s entirely possible game. It\u2019s entirely possible Washington\u2019s playing week one in Washington\u2019s playing week one in Sao Paulo. That\u2019s hardly a Sao Paulo. That\u2019s hardly a guarantee. We won\u2019t know guarantee. We won\u2019t know anything for sure until early anything for sure until early May, when the NFL finally May, when the NFL finally releases the schedule, but releases the schedule, but there\u2019s going to be a ton of there\u2019s going to be a ton of speculation about it. One more speculation about it. One more thought, though. Washington also thought, though. Washington also plays at Miami this season. plays at Miami this season. Well, the Dolphins have a home Well, the Dolphins have a home game in Madrid, so it\u2019s not only game in Madrid, so it\u2019s not only possible that Washington could possible that Washington could play at Brazil, it\u2019s possible play at Brazil, it\u2019s possible Washington plays in Spain. They Washington plays in Spain. They won\u2019t play both of those. I won\u2019t play both of those. I don\u2019t think the NFL is going to don\u2019t think the NFL is going to send a team on two different send a team on two different international trips, but lot of international trips, but lot of interesting options. And also interesting options. And also keep in mind, just with keep in mind, just with Washington\u2019s success last year, Washington\u2019s success last year, they\u2019re going to have a ton of they\u2019re going to have a ton of prime time games. So anybody prime time games. So anybody that got tired of Sunday 1:00 that got tired of Sunday 1:00 last year, you\u2019re not going to last year, you\u2019re not going to be tired of it this year. All be tired of it this year. All right. Up next, Joel Erickson right. Up next, Joel Erickson checks in, says have you heard checks in, says have you heard anything about uniform changes anything about uniform changes or when what we can expect from or when what we can expect from them? I don\u2019t know, I do believe them? I don\u2019t know, I do believe generally you have to wait five generally you have to wait five years before you make a years before you make a significant uniform change. But significant uniform change. But I do think the NFL allows for I do think the NFL allows for some leeway and perhaps some some leeway and perhaps some exemptions to that rule when exemptions to that rule when there\u2019s an ownership change. there\u2019s an ownership change. Josh Harris has been very clear Josh Harris has been very clear he\u2019d like to get back to the he\u2019d like to get back to the more classic uniforms. For me, I more classic uniforms.

Super Bowl. An incredible year. He\u2019s got it all. What? I thought He\u2019s got it all. What? I thought they did really well. You\u2019ve they did really well. You\u2019ve been a young quarterback in this been a young quarterback in this league. A lot of times stuff get league. A lot of times stuff get too much, gets thrown at you or too much, gets thrown at you or not enough and you\u2019re not. I not enough and you\u2019re not. I thought they brought him along thought they brought him along at kind of the perfect pace. How at kind of the perfect pace. How much do you think the culture much do you think the culture the DQ built? But then Cliff and the DQ built? But then Cliff and kind of the, the quarterback kind of the, the quarterback cocoon they built helped this cocoon they built helped this thing. I think that, you know, thing. I think that, you know, that\u2019s the big thing. Hey, I\u2019ve that\u2019s the big thing. Hey, I\u2019ve been critical of Kliff been critical of Kliff Kingsbury\u2019s offense in the past. Kingsbury\u2019s offense in the past. Like like it. But I\u2019ve always Like like it. But I\u2019ve always gone, oh, you know, I wish there gone, oh, you know, I wish there was a little more or, you know, was a little more or, you know, a few new wrinkles as the season a few new wrinkles as the season went on. I can\u2019t say any of that went on. I can\u2019t say any of that about Kliff Kingsbury and what about Kliff Kingsbury and what he did, but Jayden Daniels and he did, but Jayden Daniels and the approach in which he took, the approach in which he took, like you said, to kind of bring like you said, to kind of bring him along the right way. I think him along the right way. I think one of the unspoken things about one of the unspoken things about how good the first year was is how good the first year was is that the Jayden got to run an that the Jayden got to run an offense that was very similar in offense that was very similar in college, so there wasn\u2019t a huge college, so there wasn\u2019t a huge learning curve there. But within learning curve there. But within that, okay, you do that and then that, okay, you do that and then as it goes along, they added as it goes along, they added more and more on his plate. And more and more on his plate. And so the way he brought him there so the way he brought him there and then the confidence he and then the confidence he brought with it, and then the brought with it, and then the formula he concocted with his formula he concocted with his talent and some of the other talent and some of the other things he really like not only things he really like not only made Jayden comfortable, but he made Jayden comfortable, but he put his defenses in a bind to put his defenses in a bind to also make Jayden more also make Jayden more comfortable as well, and just comfortable as well, and just was blown away by everything he was blown away by everything he did this year. Offensively, they did this year. Offensively, they were really impressive, maybe were really impressive, maybe without some of the top pieces, without some of the top pieces, right? And then you\u2019re able to right? And then you\u2019re able to get to the NFC title game. Now get to the NFC title game. Now they were outclassed by Philly I they were outclassed by Philly I think we kind of expected he\u2019s think we kind of expected he\u2019s an all star team I mean Philly an all star team I mean Philly is one of the I I\u2019m not joking is one of the I I\u2019m not joking you I\u2019ve been trying to tell you I\u2019ve been trying to tell this to people here all week. this to people here all week. The Philadelphia offensive line The Philadelphia offensive line is as good as the Cowboys in the is as good as the Cowboys in the 90s. This is the Eagles are one 90s. This is the Eagles are one of the best, most well of the best, most well orchestrated team in the salary orchestrated team in the salary cap era. They are in. It\u2019s the cap era. They are in. It\u2019s the best O-line in football, the best O-line in football, the best D-line in football, a top best D-line in football, a top ten quarterback, the best ten quarterback, the best running back in football, maybe running back in football, maybe the best dual receiver in the best dual receiver in football and good linebackers football and good linebackers and secondary. Right? So there\u2019s and secondary. Right? So there\u2019s really not a weakness. And yeah, really not a weakness. And yeah, you guys aren\u2019t there yet. But you guys aren\u2019t there yet. But you\u2019re coming. So obviously you\u2019re coming. So obviously being in the NFC East with being in the NFC East with Philly who\u2019s so loaded I think Philly who\u2019s so loaded I think O-line and D-line just trumps O-line and D-line just trumps everything in the league, right. everything in the league, right. What does Washington need to do What does Washington need to do to get past Philly? Like how did to get past Philly? Like how did how did they need to change how did they need to change their mindset for we\u2019re going to their mindset for we\u2019re going to try to win this division, try to win this division, because if we do, we win. The because if we do, we win. The conference offensive line was conference offensive line was better than I thought it was better than I thought it was going to be in Washington. Now, going to be in Washington. Now, you know, an improvement there, you know, an improvement there, maybe some bigger people on the, maybe some bigger people on the, you know, the edges of the you know, the edges of the defense a little bit. You know, defense a little bit. You know, you had some some good play you had some some good play there certainly by Dante Fowler. there certainly by Dante Fowler. And you know the other guy from And you know the other guy from Dallas, Dorance Armstrong. Thank Dallas, Dorance Armstrong. Thank you very much. You know, they you very much. You know, they really did. But you know to really did. But you know to combat that Eagles offensive combat that Eagles offensive line you\u2019re going to need talent line you\u2019re going to need talent size and depth. You know I think size and depth. You know I think that\u2019s the thing they\u2019re going that\u2019s the thing they\u2019re going to look for. Do they look for to look for. Do they look for another receiver to go with another receiver to go with Terry McLaurin on the offensive Terry McLaurin on the offensive side of the ball. Right. Dyami side of the ball. Right. Dyami Brown really did come along on Brown really did come along on the you know second half of the the you know second half of the year. But I would imagine that year. But I would imagine that they probably look for another they probably look for another weapon there. And then I think weapon there. And then I think the great thing about it is like the great thing about it is like you\u2019re saying they\u2019re going to you\u2019re saying they\u2019re going to have to address size and have to address size and physicality when you got physicality when you got Philadelphia in your in your Philadelphia in your in your division. But man money, the division. But man money, the most of the hard work is done most of the hard work is done with the roster. And the fact with the roster. And the fact that you have Jayden Daniels that you have Jayden Daniels there free agents where it\u2019s a there free agents where it\u2019s a tie, they\u2019re going to go I\u2019m tie, they\u2019re going to go I\u2019m going to go to Washington going to go to Washington because Jayden Daniels is there. because Jayden Daniels is there. And that\u2019s the other advantage And that\u2019s the other advantage you guys have here going into you guys have here going into the future. Tie goes to the the future. Tie goes to the runner. Tie goes to Washington. runner. Tie goes to Washington. We\u2019re live in New Orleans. Don\u2019t We\u2019re live in New Orleans. Don\u2019t go anywhere. Got to look at serve.

This one\u2019s coming down to the wire against coming down to the wire against Philadelphia. Hard, hard to Philadelphia. Hard, hard to think otherwise. Fletch. think otherwise. Fletch. Obviously Saquon Barkley is such Obviously Saquon Barkley is such a huge threat in this thing a huge threat in this thing defensively. What do you want to defensively. What do you want to see them do to try to slow see them do to try to slow Saquon down? Well, what you got Saquon down? Well, what you got to do with a back like Saquon is to do with a back like Saquon is you\u2019re going to need a lot of you\u2019re going to need a lot of discipline and patience. And I discipline and patience. And I say patience because Saquon can. say patience because Saquon can. He\u2019ll have you think he\u2019s going He\u2019ll have you think he\u2019s going to go into one gap. You get you to go into one gap. You get you to get out of your gap. You\u2019re to get out of your gap. You\u2019re supposed to have. And from the supposed to have. And from the run fit. And then he has enough run fit. And then he has enough speed and explosiveness to come speed and explosiveness to come back and hit you and increase back and hit you and increase you in that gap. Guy\u2019s going to you in that gap. Guy\u2019s going to have to be disciplined in their have to be disciplined in their run fits. Be patient, get off run fits. Be patient, get off blocks, stay square against the blocks, stay square against the line of scrimmage and not allow line of scrimmage and not allow him to have the explosive, him to have the explosive, explosive run. You\u2019re not going explosive run. You\u2019re not going to stop him. But if we can, we to stop him. But if we can, we can contain him. Relatively can contain him. Relatively speaking, I think we are. We\u2019ll speaking, I think we are. We\u2019ll come out of Philly with a win. come out of Philly with a win. Well, and one area they had a Well, and one area they had a lot of success against the Lions lot of success against the Lions was getting the run game going. was getting the run game going. Brian Robinson had his best game Brian Robinson had his best game in probably two months. Jaden in probably two months. Jaden was able to do his thing. Do you was able to do his thing. Do you think they\u2019ll be able to run think they\u2019ll be able to run against Philly tomorrow? This is against Philly tomorrow? This is a really good defense. I think a really good defense. I think there\u2019s two big questions. The there\u2019s two big questions. The other side of the ball Jalen other side of the ball Jalen Hurts, we could probably talk Hurts, we could probably talk about, but this one as well. Can about, but this one as well. Can they sustain a run game against they sustain a run game against that defensive line minus their that defensive line minus their best offensive lineman in Sam best offensive lineman in Sam Cosmi. That\u2019s a big deal here. Cosmi. That\u2019s a big deal here. So I\u2019m not sure we know the So I\u2019m not sure we know the answer to that. But I will say answer to that. But I will say this. I do expect the ball not this. I do expect the ball not unlike last week out of Jayden unlike last week out of Jayden Daniels hands. Fast start a Daniels hands. Fast start a quick game, get the ball on the quick game, get the ball on the outside, work the middle of the outside, work the middle of the field and hopefully open it up a field and hopefully open it up a little bit to give them some little bit to give them some room to run the ball and Fletch, room to run the ball and Fletch, you see the highlights here. I you see the highlights here. I mean, this defense has been mean, this defense has been really good in the playoffs and really good in the playoffs and they\u2019re really good at they\u2019re really good at generating turnovers. How do you generating turnovers. How do you keep that going against a Philly keep that going against a Philly team that protects the ball a team that protects the ball a little bit more than Tampa and little bit more than Tampa and Detroit? Yeah, I think the last Detroit? Yeah, I think the last couple of weeks, especially the couple of weeks, especially the game against the Detroit Lions, game against the Detroit Lions, I thought Joe Whitt, junior I thought Joe Whitt, junior defensive coordinator, had a defensive coordinator, had a magnificent scheme against Jared magnificent scheme against Jared Goff. And I expect to see a lot Goff. And I expect to see a lot of similar things, a lot of of similar things, a lot of confusion. Shawn man playing confusion. Shawn man playing zone coverage. Didn\u2019t Jalen zone coverage. Didn\u2019t Jalen Hurts to try to hold on the Hurts to try to hold on the football a little bit longer? He football a little bit longer? He he took seven sacks last week he took seven sacks last week against the Rams because he does against the Rams because he does have a tendency to hold on to have a tendency to hold on to the football. But if we can get the football. But if we can get him to hold on to the ball a him to hold on to the ball a little bit longer, maybe it\u2019s a little bit longer, maybe it\u2019s a forced fumble. Maybe it\u2019s a forced fumble. Maybe it\u2019s a couple sacks for fumbles and couple sacks for fumbles and he\u2019ll he\u2019ll take a chance or two he\u2019ll he\u2019ll take a chance or two and we got to get our hands on and we got to get our hands on the football. Hurts is relative. the football. Hurts is relative. Health is the game. Absolutely. Health is the game. Absolutely. It\u2019s the game. If he\u2019s immobile It\u2019s the game. If he\u2019s immobile he\u2019s such an effective runner. he\u2019s such an effective runner. Yes. But if he\u2019s not what do Yes. But if he\u2019s not what do they got? I mean the passing they got? I mean the passing game is he hurt us a couple of game is he hurt us a couple of times in both games scrambling. times in both games scrambling. So to Brown\u2019s point, if he\u2019s not So to Brown\u2019s point, if he\u2019s not 100% and it\u2019s all on Saquon, 100% and it\u2019s all on Saquon, then watch this defense. then watch this defense. Absolutely. I got to show you we Absolutely. I got to show you we had our cameras were at Dulles had our cameras were at Dulles when y\u2019all took off I guess a when y\u2019all took off I guess a few hours ago. This is a pretty few hours ago.

And, you know, it\u2019s people Bowl. And, you know, it\u2019s people like me at my age that have told like me at my age that have told a generation of people what it\u2019s a generation of people what it\u2019s like when this team wins. We\u2019re like when this team wins. We\u2019re finally in the space where we finally in the space where we could show them what it is like, could show them what it is like, what this team means to the what this team means to the town, what it means to the town, what it means to the community.

When you get deep in the When you get deep in the playoffs like this, it becomes playoffs like this, it becomes more emotional than anything. I more emotional than anything. I think my father\u2019s gone. I think think my father\u2019s gone. I think about him that I would call him about him that I would call him after these games, but what has after these games, but what has been so special to me? My two been so special to me? My two young daughters, nine and six young daughters, nine and six years old, all of a sudden they years old, all of a sudden they are obsessed by my daughter. We are obsessed by my daughter. We got her a new Commanders jacket got her a new Commanders jacket for Christmas. She hasn\u2019t let us for Christmas. She hasn\u2019t let us wash it because she thinks bad wash it because she thinks bad luck will come. And it\u2019s just. luck will come. And it\u2019s just. Maybe you lost a generation of Maybe you lost a generation of fans, but you\u2019re getting them fans, but you\u2019re getting them back in a hurry. How good does back in a hurry. How good does Jayden Daniels need to be for Jayden Daniels need to be for them to be going to New Orleans? them to be going to New Orleans? Well, Jaden, Jaden needs to be Well, Jaden, Jaden needs to be Jaden, you know, continue to do Jaden, you know, continue to do what he\u2019s been doing. I\u2019m what he\u2019s been doing. I\u2019m anxious to see what type of anxious to see what type of scheme Vic Fangio tried to scheme Vic Fangio tried to deploy against him. The first deploy against him. The first game here in Philly, they didn\u2019t game here in Philly, they didn\u2019t blitz him a lot, only like 10% blitz him a lot, only like 10% of the of his drop backs. Last of the of his drop backs. Last time when we played him in time when we played him in Northwest Stadium, he died up Northwest Stadium, he died up 36% pressure rate and Jayden 36% pressure rate and Jayden sliced him up. We saw what sliced him up. We saw what Jayden did against the Detroit Jayden did against the Detroit Lions when they blitzed him, so Lions when they blitzed him, so I think it\u2019ll be a kind of a I think it\u2019ll be a kind of a mix. Maybe they try to pressure mix. Maybe they try to pressure him maybe 20% of the time, but him maybe 20% of the time, but the key is can we block Jalen the key is can we block Jalen Carter in the passing game and Carter in the passing game and we can get him blocked? Jayden we can get him blocked? Jayden is going to be. I feel like is going to be. I feel like he\u2019ll be able to make plays he\u2019ll be able to make plays against this defense in the against this defense in the passing game. There\u2019s a big passing game. There\u2019s a big reason why they\u2019re here. Jayden reason why they\u2019re here. Jayden Daniels a big reason why they\u2019re Daniels a big reason why they\u2019re here tomorrow is about their here tomorrow is about their defense. It is going to be very defense.

Their secondary now with Lattimore and Sam Rice still, Lattimore and Sam Rice still, you got two really physical you got two really physical corners that are willing to corners that are willing to engage and run support. You saw engage and run support. You saw Lattimore in the Tampa game. Lattimore in the Tampa game. Take Bucky Irving out. Yeah Take Bucky Irving out. Yeah Bucky cut it up when he had a Bucky cut it up when he had a sure first down I think he was sure first down I think he was scared of the hit that could scared of the hit that could make a difference. Saquon is a make a difference. Saquon is a star I don\u2019t want to overstate star I don\u2019t want to overstate it. But if you could just limit it. But if you could just limit him even if you keep him to 100 him even if you keep him to 100 yards, I was going to say you yards, I was going to say you got to try to keep him up to got to try to keep him up to 100, maybe even he had like 200 100, maybe even he had like 200 yards against rushing. Prop is a yards against rushing. Prop is a buck 25. That\u2019s insanely high. buck 25. That\u2019s insanely high. That is insanely high. Yeah. So That is insanely high. Yeah.

My question is this. I think a huge part of is this. I think a huge part of our success has been able to our success has been able to convert these fourth downs. I convert these fourth downs. I feel like this season we feel like this season we converted all of our fourth converted all of our fourth downs. 11 for 11. Can we make it downs. 11 for 11. Can we make it 12 tomorrow? And how crucial is 12 tomorrow? And how crucial is it for us to be able to move the it for us to be able to move the chains when we get behind on chains when we get behind on downs? It\u2019s a great question and downs? It\u2019s a great question and honestly, the fourth downs honestly, the fourth downs success is a huge part of this success is a huge part of this offense. If you look at what offense. If you look at what they do, it\u2019s pretty damn they do, it\u2019s pretty damn miraculous, frankly. What Kliff miraculous, frankly. What Kliff Kingsbury has dialed up where Kingsbury has dialed up where they don\u2019t have much run game they don\u2019t have much run game going. Think about it. They going. Think about it. They don\u2019t have the run game outside don\u2019t have the run game outside of Detroit. Hasn\u2019t really worked of Detroit. Hasn\u2019t really worked in six weeks. I kind of think it in six weeks. I kind of think it worked in Detroit because worked in Detroit because Detroit\u2019s defense is bad, but Detroit\u2019s defense is bad, but they still are able to win time they still are able to win time of possession because they of possession because they control things through the short control things through the short passing game and then going for passing game and then going for it on fourth down. DQ has said it on fourth down. DQ has said this bold but not reckless this bold but not reckless throughout. That\u2019s their throughout. That\u2019s their decision making process and they decision making process and they got to keep it going tomorrow. got to keep it going tomorrow. Absolutely. You got to be Absolutely.

Try to figure out what the recipe is for a win the recipe is for a win tomorrow. One day after the tomorrow. One day after the Commanders second straight loss, Commanders second straight loss, this time to the Philadelphia this time to the Philadelphia Eagles, the entire DMV is Eagles, the entire DMV is talking about one decision that talking about one decision that will be Washington head coach will be Washington head coach Dan Quinn electing to go for it Dan Quinn electing to go for it on a fourth and two in the on a fourth and two in the fourth quarter, instead of fourth quarter, instead of taking a field goal that might taking a field goal that might have given Washington the lead. have given Washington the lead. DQ defended his actions, said DQ defended his actions, said bold calls were needed. We were bold calls were needed. We were prepared for that moment. I prepared for that moment. I don\u2019t love the execution, but don\u2019t love the execution, but we\u2019ve been an excellent fourth we\u2019ve been an excellent fourth down team, so going into it, we down team, so going into it, we knew we\u2019d have to take our shots knew we\u2019d have to take our shots against a tough division team on against a tough division team on the road. We thought that was the road. We thought that was appropriate. One certainly don\u2019t appropriate. One certainly don\u2019t like the execution and the like the execution and the result I\u2019m always a part of. result I\u2019m always a part of. Hey, let\u2019s go for it. You know, Hey, let\u2019s go for it. You know, I trust my teammates, I trust I trust my teammates, I trust the unit. So I always trust the the unit. So I always trust the coaches. I never question them. coaches. I never question them. I mean, that\u2019s that\u2019s the nature I mean, that\u2019s that\u2019s the nature of this team. We\u2019re aggressive. of this team. We\u2019re aggressive. We\u2019re going to go for it any We\u2019re going to go for it any chance we can. And you know it\u2019s chance we can. And you know it\u2019s on us as players to go ahead and on us as players to go ahead and execute and you know make that execute and you know make that payoff. It would not surprise me payoff. It would not surprise me if they ran this ball with if they ran this ball with Saquon. Here\u2019s the snap to Saquon. Here\u2019s the snap to hurts. You got it right off the hurts. You got it right off the edge and he gets there 2015 edge and he gets there 2015 racing to the ten five and the racing to the ten five and the pylon. And he\u2019s in. Touchdown pylon. And he\u2019s in. Touchdown Philadelphia Saquon you know we Philadelphia Saquon you know we stopped in the first three stopped in the first three quarters. And he kind of found quarters. And he kind of found his his niche at the end. And his his niche at the end. And you know we just got to play all you know we just got to play all four quarters. We did a good job four quarters. We did a good job early on keeping him you know early on keeping him you know contained. And it\u2019s just we contained. And it\u2019s just we can\u2019t let up towards the end I can\u2019t let up towards the end I mean when expectations are high mean when expectations are high one win or one loss feels like one win or one loss feels like five two losses, feels like 15 five two losses, feels like 15 in a row. And so it\u2019s just part in a row. And so it\u2019s just part of the thing when you got to of the thing when you got to when your expectations are high when your expectations are high for yourself and you\u2019re not able for yourself and you\u2019re not able to pull it off, you\u2019re going to to pull it off, you\u2019re going to hurt, it\u2019s going to sting. And hurt, it\u2019s going to sting. And we\u2019ll be back back at them again we\u2019ll be back back at them again and, you know, 5 or 6 weeks. So and, you know, 5 or 6 weeks. So we\u2019ll get plenty of chances to we\u2019ll get plenty of chances to look at it. But yeah, this one, look at it. But yeah, this one, you know, just not being you know, just not being delivered. Like we were really delivered. Like we were really ready to go fight for it. And ready to go fight for it.

No Da\u2019ron Payne with ball here. No Da\u2019ron Payne with this Eagles rushing attack. What this Eagles rushing attack. What do you make of that blow I mean do you make of that blow I mean Sheldon Day is probably going to Sheldon Day is probably going to increase. You need a lot from increase. You need a lot from John Allen. Big opportunity for John Allen. Big opportunity for him. He\u2019s been very good through him. He\u2019s been very good through two playoff games. Yes he\u2019s been two playoff games. Yes he\u2019s been slowly getting better since he slowly getting better since he came back from that pec injury. came back from that pec injury. And you look at that that Eagles And you look at that that Eagles rushing attack. You need as many rushing attack. You need as many big bodies as you can get for big bodies as you can get for the Commanders on the field. And the Commanders on the field. And getting Sheldon Day there, getting Sheldon Day there, moving John Allen to the outside moving John Allen to the outside to play kind of defensive end. to play kind of defensive end. He can be a guy that can help He can be a guy that can help slow it down. Man. The slow it down. Man. The Commanders defense has done a Commanders defense has done a decent job against Saquon decent job against Saquon Barkley against against the Barkley against against the Eagles except for the explosive Eagles except for the explosive except for the big plays. Right. except for the big plays. Right. We got to stop those big plays We got to stop those big plays 50% of Saquon rushes against the 50% of Saquon rushes against the Commanders have gone for two Commanders have gone for two yards or less against the rest yards or less against the rest of the NFL. That number is 37%. of the NFL. That number is 37%. So they\u2019ve done a good job of So they\u2019ve done a good job of slowing him down and not letting slowing him down and not letting him chunk you to death. Now they him chunk you to death. Now they just have to make sure they just have to make sure they don\u2019t give up the big play. I don\u2019t give up the big play. I saw some advanced stats from saw some advanced stats from Bill Barnwell. I think about Bill Barnwell. I think about Da\u2019ron Payne, the success the Da\u2019ron Payne, the success the Commanders are having Commanders are having defensively on first down with defensively on first down with Payne on the field, and that Payne on the field, and that number drops significantly number drops significantly without he\u2019s not there.

I mean Jared Goff gave it away so much I wonder if gave it away so much I wonder if they\u2019ll be able to do the same they\u2019ll be able to do the same to Jalen Hurts. It\u2019s going to be to Jalen Hurts. It\u2019s going to be fascinating to watch that fascinating to watch that happen. And here\u2019s the thing happen. And here\u2019s the thing with Washington they know Philly with Washington they know Philly really well. This is the third really well. This is the third meeting. But for Dan Quinn. And meeting. But for Dan Quinn. And honestly the way I view these honestly the way I view these things each game in the NFL is things each game in the NFL is its own entity. DQ sees it the its own entity. DQ sees it the same, the natural narrative that same, the natural narrative that you know them and they know you. you know them and they know you. And I don\u2019t really think of it And I don\u2019t really think of it that way. You start right back that way. You start right back at it, you know? What are fresh at it, you know? What are fresh eyes on the games? What are eyes on the games? What are fresh eyes on the times from fresh eyes on the times from when we played it? The easy when we played it? The easy narrative would be a they know narrative would be a they know this, we know them just. But this, we know them just. But it\u2019s different than that. To me. it\u2019s different than that. To me. This is our first time playing This is our first time playing them in the postseason game. One them in the postseason game. One what needs to be different? What what needs to be different? What could be the same? You know, could be the same? You know, what do we need to start doing? what do we need to start doing? What do we need to stop doing. What do we need to stop doing. Same thing in the second game. Same thing in the second game. And so as you get into the third And so as you get into the third matchup with somebody, you want matchup with somebody, you want to make sure you have fresh eyes to make sure you have fresh eyes for the first two. Hey, did I for the first two. Hey, did I miss something and was there miss something and was there something there that I didn\u2019t, something there that I didn\u2019t, you know, think we had or did. you know, think we had or did. And both teams will have things And both teams will have things on their call sheets that never on their call sheets that never got called in that game. And you got called in that game. And you do have those up still that do have those up still that you\u2019ve been practicing. And you\u2019ve been practicing. And sometimes every play on your sometimes every play on your call sheet doesn\u2019t make it into call sheet doesn\u2019t make it into the game and you keep those the game and you keep those alive as well. DQ also said alive as well. DQ also said earlier that at this point it\u2019s earlier that at this point it\u2019s about execution and about execution and fundamentals, not installing new fundamentals, not installing new plays or anything. How do you plays or anything. How do you approach seeing a team for a approach seeing a team for a third time and what does need to third time and what does need to be different? I think you put be different? I think you put some different wrinkles to your some different wrinkles to your game plan, and I\u2019m pretty sure game plan, and I\u2019m pretty sure they will too. But at the end of they will too. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s about, you know, the day, it\u2019s about, you know, execution and fundamentals. And execution and fundamentals. And that\u2019s a very good team that that\u2019s a very good team that we\u2019re going to face for a third we\u2019re going to face for a third time again. So they got a lot of time again. So they got a lot of good players. Obviously we know good players. Obviously we know them. They know us. So it\u2019s them. They know us. So it\u2019s going to be a fun matchup going going to be a fun matchup going going up against them on Sunday. going up against them on Sunday. You kind of expect it. You know You kind of expect it. You know you expect what they\u2019re going to you expect what they\u2019re going to do what they\u2019re going to bring. do what they\u2019re going to bring. You kind of know who you\u2019re You kind of know who you\u2019re playing against. But at the end playing against. But at the end of the day you know you still of the day you know you still have to, you know, stay focused have to, you know, stay focused because a lot of things happen because a lot of things happen in different games the first in different games the first game. So things happen with game. So things happen with turnovers. The second game we turnovers. The second game we came back. So this one, you know came back. So this one, you know you just want to play a complete you just want to play a complete football game a complete football game a complete football game is a tremendous football game is a tremendous idea for Washington. Obviously idea for Washington. Obviously they\u2019ve played Philly twice this they\u2019ve played Philly twice this season. They won one. They lost season. They won one. They lost one. Both teams held serve at one. Both teams held serve at home. But for Washington it\u2019s home. But for Washington it\u2019s really been about Saquon really been about Saquon Barkley. Keep this in mind too Barkley. Keep this in mind too as they approach Philly again as they approach Philly again Jonathan Allen the team\u2019s star Jonathan Allen the team\u2019s star defensive tackle missed both of defensive tackle missed both of those games against the Eagles. those games against the Eagles. He\u2019s back on the field. He\u2019s He\u2019s back on the field.

A veteran with an opportunity to A veteran with an opportunity to go to the Super Bowl. You know go to the Super Bowl. You know it\u2019s going to mean a lot for it\u2019s going to mean a lot for Jay. You heard Jaden there talk Jay. You heard Jaden there talk about the opportunity to play about the opportunity to play Philly again. But one thing Philly again. But one thing we\u2019ve all talked about at length we\u2019ve all talked about at length is his poise, his calm nature. is his poise, his calm nature. And one thing that becomes clear And one thing that becomes clear with Jayden Daniels. He\u2019s just with Jayden Daniels. He\u2019s just so comfortable on the football so comfortable on the football field. I just think for me, field. I just think for me, football is just it\u2019s fun and football is just it\u2019s fun and like I said, it\u2019s like a safe like I said, it\u2019s like a safe haven for me. Everything I\u2019ve haven for me. Everything I\u2019ve been through personally in my been through personally in my life. So, you know, I\u2019m not life. So, you know, I\u2019m not really going out there and really going out there and stressing about the moment stressing about the moment because at the end of the day, I because at the end of the day, I get to do what I love each and get to do what I love each and every week, you know, win, lose every week, you know, win, lose or draw. So it\u2019s just a blessing or draw. So it\u2019s just a blessing to be one of those kids that is to be one of those kids that is able to fulfill their dream and able to fulfill their dream and live out their dream of playing live out their dream of playing on Sundays in the NFL. What a on Sundays in the NFL. What a humble, measured young man that humble, measured young man that is playing arguably the best at is playing arguably the best at the quarterback position in the the quarterback position in the entire NFL. There\u2019s only four entire NFL. There\u2019s only four teams left, and it\u2019s either him teams left, and it\u2019s either him or Josh Allen playing the best or Josh Allen playing the best right now. And I think it\u2019s right now. And I think it\u2019s Jaden. Let\u2019s go from there into Jaden. Let\u2019s go from there into the locker room. Here is what the locker room. Here is what they\u2019re saying as these players they\u2019re saying as these players are getting ready for a rubber are getting ready for a rubber match against Philly. There\u2019s match against Philly. There\u2019s blood in this. It\u2019s major blood in this. It\u2019s major because you know it\u2019s some blood because you know it\u2019s some blood in it for sure for sure. This is in it for sure for sure. This is a tough team. You know we beat a tough team. You know we beat them once they beat us. them once they beat us. Obviously they\u2019ve been you know Obviously they\u2019ve been you know the hierarchy of the division the hierarchy of the division for years now. So but every year for years now. So but every year is a new year. And this team is a new year. And this team before we started this year before we started this year hadn\u2019t lost or win any game. So hadn\u2019t lost or win any game. So all that matters is right now. all that matters is right now. And we feel like we\u2019re the best And we feel like we\u2019re the best team. All that matters is right team. All that matters is right now. Very true. Words from a guy now. Very true. Words from a guy in Cleveland Farrell that has in Cleveland Farrell that has been in some big playoff games, been in some big playoff games, some big opportunities. And I some big opportunities. And I think throughout the Washington think throughout the Washington locker room, they recognize how locker room, they recognize how big the impact is of these big the impact is of these games. Think about a guy like games. Think about a guy like Brian Robinson, who had a really Brian Robinson, who had a really big game last week in Detroit. big game last week in Detroit. And the run game had really been And the run game had really been quiet for a while for B-Rob and quiet for a while for B-Rob and for this offense and this for this offense and this defense and the players in that defense and the players in that locker room. So much of this locker room. So much of this becomes about trust. That\u2019s the becomes about trust. That\u2019s the perfect reassurance that any perfect reassurance that any player will want from their head player will want from their head coach. You know, just, you know, coach. You know, just, you know, it was as simple as just, you it was as simple as just, you know, skimming through a few few know, skimming through a few few plays. It\u2019s like, yo, you know, plays. It\u2019s like, yo, you know, this is what you, you know, this this is what you, you know, this is who you are. You know, you is who you are. You know, you know, it\u2019s easy. You know, it\u2019s know, it\u2019s easy. You know, it\u2019s easy to connect that way. And, easy to connect that way. And, you know, DQ got a lot of you know, DQ got a lot of respect from me. Just not even respect from me. Just not even just from that moment. It\u2019s been just from that moment. It\u2019s been several moments where I feel several moments where I feel like he\u2019s, you know, just, you like he\u2019s, you know, just, you know, reassuring me in the right know, reassuring me in the right way and just allowing me to know way and just allowing me to know how much he cares about me and how much he cares about me and my success. So, you know, that\u2019s my success. So, you know, that\u2019s a great feeling. Dan Quinn might a great feeling. Dan Quinn might wear that hat backwards, but he wear that hat backwards, but he is absolutely put to Commanders is absolutely put to Commanders on a forward trajectory. I think on a forward trajectory. I think the players to a man in that the players to a man in that locker room believe in DQ locker room believe in DQ because he\u2019s disciplined, he\u2019s because he\u2019s disciplined, he\u2019s consistent, but he\u2019s honest. consistent, but he\u2019s honest.

A big they have gone so far. A big part of it, though. Jayden part of it, though. Jayden Daniels, let\u2019s get to something Daniels, let\u2019s get to something you missed. Here\u2019s Terry you missed. Here\u2019s Terry McLaurin telling a story about McLaurin telling a story about when he realized how much Jayden when he realized how much Jayden Daniels hates losing.

Dude I don\u2019t know that playoffs. Dude I don\u2019t know that the Eagles beat the Rams last the Eagles beat the Rams last week without Jalen Carter. But week without Jalen Carter. But they definitely don\u2019t beat him they definitely don\u2019t beat him without Saquon because he scores without Saquon because he scores like if you have to pick a like if you have to pick a dominant threat to slow down, dominant threat to slow down, it\u2019s the dude that\u2019s going to it\u2019s the dude that\u2019s going to carry the ball into the end carry the ball into the end zone.

Number two, we\u2019re going to move Number two, we\u2019re going to move on to Commanders crew. If you on to Commanders crew. If you had to pick one specific had to pick one specific position group outside of the position group outside of the quarterback, that needs to have quarterback, that needs to have a near flawless game on Sunday, a near flawless game on Sunday, which group is it? It\u2019s the which group is it? It\u2019s the front seven. I would say it\u2019s front seven. I would say it\u2019s either your D-line or your either your D-line or your linebackers. I\u2019m just going to linebackers. I\u2019m just going to bulk them together and say it\u2019s bulk them together and say it\u2019s the front seven. You got Josh the front seven. You got Josh Allen, Da\u2019ron Payne, Johnny Allen, Da\u2019ron Payne, Johnny Newton. They\u2019ve been playing Newton. They\u2019ve been playing better on the edges. Wagner Luvu better on the edges. Wagner Luvu this is your chance, fellas, and this is your chance, fellas, and you probably need some safety you probably need some safety support. Jeremy Chinn certainly support. Jeremy Chinn certainly I know I\u2019m naming like nine I know I\u2019m naming like nine people here as it\u2019s supposed to people here as it\u2019s supposed to be one position group, but if be one position group, but if Saquon is the focus, you need Saquon is the focus, you need that D-line to be at their that D-line to be at their absolute best. I\u2019m aware of how absolute best. I\u2019m aware of how good Philly\u2019s offensive line is. good Philly\u2019s offensive line is. Everybody talks about Saquon. It Everybody talks about Saquon. It should really be Saquon and that should really be Saquon and that Philly O-line as a group because Philly O-line as a group because they\u2019re fantastic. But you got they\u2019re fantastic. But you got it. You got to fight fire with it. You got to fight fire with fire this week. Your D-line has fire this week. Your D-line has got to be at their best. They\u2019ve got to be at their best.

Could offensive line change. Could that mean you bump Andrew Wylie that mean you bump Andrew Wylie from tackle to guard. And then from tackle to guard. And then you put Cornelius Lucas at right you put Cornelius Lucas at right tackle. It could mean that I tackle. It could mean that I still kind of think they\u2019re still kind of think they\u2019re going to go with Trent Scott. going to go with Trent Scott.

One nugget Pete left out. Both of these Pete left out. Both of these teams are coached by dudes named teams are coached by dudes named Dan that have Goatees. Now, that Dan that have Goatees. Now, that stuff like that only comes from stuff like that only comes from my brain. Gio Del Fa joins us. my brain. Gio Del Fa joins us. Time for the mailbag like we do Time for the mailbag like we do every week. GDF how are we every week. GDF how are we doing? That\u2019s right. We\u2019re doing doing? That\u2019s right. We\u2019re doing pretty good. We got the first pretty good. We got the first one from ash. Burning. Ash one from ash. Burning. Ash burning. I like that burning run burning. I like that burning run game. What\u2019s the beef, JP? Back game. What\u2019s the beef, JP? Back scheme or O-line need scheme or O-line need production. Here. Are teams just production. Here. Are teams just stacking for it? I don\u2019t think stacking for it? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a simple answer here, there\u2019s a simple answer here, and I know people want a simple and I know people want a simple answer. People want to blame the answer. People want to blame the back or blame the line or back or blame the line or whatever it is. I think it\u2019s a whatever it is. I think it\u2019s a combination of all three, combination of all three, honestly. But I do think it\u2019s honestly. But I do think it\u2019s important that we keep in mind, important that we keep in mind, even though the ypc isn\u2019t there, even though the ypc isn\u2019t there, the gaudy statistics that we saw the gaudy statistics that we saw earlier in the year aren\u2019t there earlier in the year aren\u2019t there in the run game for Kliff in the run game for Kliff Kingsbury and Dan Quinn, Kingsbury and Dan Quinn, establishing the run is very establishing the run is very important. Yeah, it\u2019s helped me important. Yeah, it\u2019s helped me having a defensive head coach, I having a defensive head coach, I can tell you that much because can tell you that much because he lets it be known we need to he lets it be known we need to run the football at times that I run the football at times that I would maybe in my previous life would maybe in my previous life be airing it out, but we\u2019re be airing it out, but we\u2019re going to do whatever it takes to going to do whatever it takes to win and we have good backs and win and we have good backs and we\u2019ve had a great scheme we\u2019ve had a great scheme throughout the year. We\u2019ve faced throughout the year. We\u2019ve faced some good fronts. I mean, those some good fronts. I mean, those two guys inside, they\u2019re as good two guys inside, they\u2019re as good as anybody we\u2019ve played against as anybody we\u2019ve played against all year at Tampa and the all year at Tampa and the linebackers are tremendous linebackers are tremendous players, so it was a challenge. players, so it was a challenge. Todd Bowles was one of the best Todd Bowles was one of the best defensive minds in the league defensive minds in the league and has been for a long time. So and has been for a long time. So overall it\u2019s a challenge and I overall it\u2019s a challenge and I thought it was important to have thought it was important to have that in there. Just to have that in there. Just to have Cliff explain that DQ wants to Cliff explain that DQ wants to keep the run in and what it does keep the run in and what it does to defenses in the second half. to defenses in the second half. Always hammers me about that, Always hammers me about that, that even if you\u2019re not getting that even if you\u2019re not getting the yardage, committing to it the yardage, committing to it and letting those old linemen go and letting those old linemen go forward rather than backing up. forward rather than backing up. Remember the EB years when we Remember the EB years when we saw him just go backwards? It\u2019s saw him just go backwards? It\u2019s everybody involved. Maybe it everybody involved. Maybe it gets going in Detroit that I\u2019m gets going in Detroit that I\u2019m not so sure it will. All right. not so sure it will. All right. Second question from Parker. Second question from Parker. Offensive weapon outside of Offensive weapon outside of Terry and Ertz that you would Terry and Ertz that you would like to see step up big I mean like to see step up big I mean heck we just talked about the heck we just talked about the run game. You\u2019d love if this was run game. You\u2019d love if this was the game Brian Robinson all of a the game Brian Robinson all of a sudden could get it going again. sudden could get it going again. I\u2019ll say the same thing I said I\u2019ll say the same thing I said in Tampa though. I think it\u2019s in Tampa though. I think it\u2019s Austin Ekeler I think he\u2019s way Austin Ekeler I think he\u2019s way more explosive. Detroit doesn\u2019t more explosive. Detroit doesn\u2019t blitz quite like Tampa does, but blitz quite like Tampa does, but Detroit tries to bring a lot of Detroit tries to bring a lot of different pressures. I think different pressures. I think Ekeler is your best pass Ekeler is your best pass protection block blocker. And protection block blocker. And then I think he can slip out get then I think he can slip out get open let Jayden find him. Dump open let Jayden find him. Dump it off to him. I think it\u2019s got it off to him. I think it\u2019s got to be Ekeler here. Maybe Dyami to be Ekeler here. Maybe Dyami Brown. He had a monster game in Brown. He had a monster game in Tampa. That\u2019s right that\u2019s Tampa. That\u2019s right that\u2019s right. And number three do you right. And number three do you think that this defense has what think that this defense has what it takes to stand up against the it takes to stand up against the Lions offense. I know we only Lions offense. I know we only allowed 20 points to the Bucs allowed 20 points to the Bucs but the Lions are a different but the Lions are a different beast. Who do you think wins in beast. Who do you think wins in a shootout. Jagger shout out to a shootout. Jagger shout out to no. Jack doesn\u2019t know how to no. Jack doesn\u2019t know how to spell Bucs, but that\u2019s cool, a spell Bucs, but that\u2019s cool, a shootout. You kind of lean shootout. You kind of lean towards the Lions, right? The towards the Lions, right? The Lions have been have been doing Lions have been have been doing this all year. The Lions are this all year. The Lions are really, really good. I think really, really good. I think Washington has to play at a Washington has to play at a close to great level. I do think close to great level. I do think defensively though, they\u2019ve been defensively though, they\u2019ve been quite good in the second half of quite good in the second half of games, stretching back for about games, stretching back for about a month now. Think about what a month now. Think about what they did to slow down the Eagles they did to slow down the Eagles in the second half. Atlanta in in the second half. Atlanta in the second half, Tampa last week the second half, Tampa last week in the second half. If you can in the second half. If you can get an effort like that for the get an effort like that for the whole 60. Defensively, I think whole 60. Defensively, I think it could go a long way. And it could go a long way. And maybe you slow. Detroit just has maybe you slow. Detroit just has so many weapons down Marshon so many weapons down Marshon Lattimore should be a little bit Lattimore should be a little bit better this week. That should be better this week. That should be a really big boost for the a really big boost for the defense. And lastly it\u2019s not defense. And lastly it\u2019s not really a mailbag question. Just really a mailbag question. Just the masterminds of our the masterminds of our production crew Bakari and production crew Bakari and Heather. We got some out of Heather. We got some out of context. Screengrabs why are context.

I there at Northwest Stadium? I went to the Pittsburgh game. We went to the Pittsburgh game. We had a lot of their fans there. I had a lot of their fans there. I think the Eagles, you know, they think the Eagles, you know, they travel well. Could be an issue travel well. Could be an issue as far as that game is as far as that game is concerned. But we are tracking concerned. But we are tracking the cold and that\u2019s the biggest the cold and that\u2019s the biggest thing I think that this that thing I think that this that we\u2019re going to have for this we\u2019re going to have for this game coming up during the day on game coming up during the day on Sunday. Take a look at the Sunday. Take a look at the forecast here. Kickoff at 1:00 forecast here. Kickoff at 1:00 30 degrees at that time 32. By 30 degrees at that time 32. By the time we get to halftime. And the time we get to halftime. And as we\u2019re leaving the game, by as we\u2019re leaving the game, by the time the game is ending, the time the game is ending, that temperature will be in the that temperature will be in the 20s. 29 degrees. But that\u2019s only 20s. 29 degrees. But that\u2019s only part of the story. We\u2019re still part of the story. We\u2019re still going to see a little bit of going to see a little bit of wind out there. I don\u2019t think wind out there. I don\u2019t think wind is going to be a huge wind is going to be a huge factor for the kicking game, but factor for the kicking game, but I do think it\u2019s going to add to I do think it\u2019s going to add to that chill that we see. So on that chill that we see. So on Saturday, look at the wind Saturday, look at the wind chills on Saturday here only in chills on Saturday here only in the 20s as we make our way in the 20s as we make our way in through Saturday night here at through Saturday night here at 11:00.

This Philly team barely beat the Philly team barely beat the Panthers at home two weeks ago. Panthers at home two weeks ago. Football is a crazy, crazy sport Football is a crazy, crazy sport where each week is its own where each week is its own entity. Speaking of its own entity. Speaking of its own entity for nuggets from Pete entity for nuggets from Pete Haley now. While Washington\u2019s Haley now. While Washington\u2019s win in the Big Easy was big win in the Big Easy was big stressful, consider these stressful, consider these reasons for optimism. The reasons for optimism. The offense is sixth on third downs, offense is sixth on third downs, tied for first on fourth downs tied for first on fourth downs and seventh in the red zone, and seventh in the red zone, being in the top ten of those being in the top ten of those clutch categories. This late in clutch categories. This late in the year is big, encouraging. the year is big, encouraging. Jayden Daniels completed 80.7% Jayden Daniels completed 80.7% of his throws versus the Saints of his throws versus the Saints counting contests, where he counting contests, where he threw at least ten passes. threw at least ten passes.

Only Jared Goff has more such Jared Goff has more such performances in 2024. Marshon performances in 2024. Marshon Lattimore Commanders debut Lattimore Commanders debut couldn\u2019t have been less eye couldn\u2019t have been less eye catching, which is precisely catching, which is precisely what every fan should want.

Next up, targeted, not once. Next up, A.J. Brown, Devonta Smith and A.J. Brown, Devonta Smith and that revitalized Eagles passing that revitalized Eagles passing offense Sunday will represent offense Sunday will represent Terry Mclaurin\u2019s 12th game Terry Mclaurin\u2019s 12th game versus Philly.

Let\u2019s hope we don\u2019t hear it on Sunday. All right. Every it on Sunday. All right. Every week we do the mailbag to help week we do the mailbag to help me sort it out. My boy. Gio Del me sort it out. My boy. Gio Del Fa GDF. What do we got, brother? Fa GDF. What do we got, brother? All right, we got some All right, we got some questions. We got some, and I questions. We got some, and I and I noticed that you weren\u2019t and I noticed that you weren\u2019t sure about all the questions. sure about all the questions. You haven\u2019t seen them yet, which You haven\u2019t seen them yet, which is always a surprise, which is always a surprise, which isn\u2019t. Okay. It should. isn\u2019t. Okay. It should. Washington stack the box against Washington stack the box against the Eagles and Dare hurts to the Eagles and Dare hurts to beat them with his arm. That\u2019s beat them with his arm. That\u2019s from Todd. Yes, especially now from Todd. Yes, especially now that you have a guy like Marshon that you have a guy like Marshon Lattimore that can match up Lattimore that can match up against AJ Brown I mean I don\u2019t against AJ Brown I mean I don\u2019t know about dare him. But I like know about dare him. But I like this game plan I think that\u2019s this game plan I think that\u2019s probably what they\u2019re going to probably what they\u2019re going to try to do. Limit Saquon okay try to do. Limit Saquon okay okay. Now we\u2019re going to go on okay. Now we\u2019re going to go on to the next question. It\u2019s going to the next question. It\u2019s going to take a minute to pop up. But to take a minute to pop up. But Greg wants to know how big of a Greg wants to know how big of a matchup will Lattimore and AJ matchup will Lattimore and AJ Brown be. These people are Brown be. These people are reading my mind right now. I reading my mind right now. I think it\u2019s huge. I think it\u2019s think it\u2019s huge. I think it\u2019s huge. I think if you can slow huge. I think if you can slow down AJ Brown, he\u2019s the biggest down AJ Brown, he\u2019s the biggest threat now. DeVante Smith\u2019s threat now. DeVante Smith\u2019s really good too. Let\u2019s not really good too. Let\u2019s not pretend that he isn\u2019t. But that pretend that he isn\u2019t. But that physical matchup between physical matchup between Lattimore, who really likes to Lattimore, who really likes to mix it up, and Brown who likes mix it up, and Brown who likes to do the same thing. I think to do the same thing. I think that will dictate a lot of this that will dictate a lot of this matchup defensively. And if you matchup defensively. And if you go back to the first game in go back to the first game in mid-November, they didn\u2019t really mid-November, they didn\u2019t really hit him that much over the top. hit him that much over the top. It was just Saquon got loose It was just Saquon got loose late. I don\u2019t know that you get late. I don\u2019t know that you get John Allen, but I do think that John Allen, but I do think that the linebackers and the D line the linebackers and the D line is performing a little bit is performing a little bit better against the run than they better against the run than they were in that stretch. We\u2019re were in that stretch. We\u2019re going to talk about Jaden also, going to talk about Jaden also, because taking into account, because taking into account, let\u2019s suppose that we\u2019re locked let\u2019s suppose that we\u2019re locked for the playoffs after beating for the playoffs after beating the Falcons sauce a cowboy fan. the Falcons sauce a cowboy fan.

Stroud and what we saw last year, which was very special. year, which was very special. This is, I think, equally up This is, I think, equally up there a little different in the there a little different in the way it\u2019s done, maybe on the way it\u2019s done, maybe on the offensive side of the ball and offensive side of the ball and all that. But you talk about all that. But you talk about incredible accuracy going to the incredible accuracy going to the right place with the ball just right place with the ball just time after time. You just don\u2019t time after time. You just don\u2019t see that stuff from rookie see that stuff from rookie quarterbacks. And in some ways, quarterbacks. And in some ways, I\u2019d say it\u2019s maybe a little more I\u2019d say it\u2019s maybe a little more impressive than C.J. Stroud, who impressive than C.J. Stroud, who was doing it off of play action, was doing it off of play action, and it was maybe 2 or 3 men down and it was maybe 2 or 3 men down the field where Jayden Daniels the field where Jayden Daniels in the shotgun, and he\u2019s in the shotgun, and he\u2019s dissecting coverage before the dissecting coverage before the snap, after the snap and then snap, after the snap and then making the appropriate ball. making the appropriate ball. What do you make of where What do you make of where Washington, and particularly the Washington, and particularly the offense as a whole is right now? offense as a whole is right now? I think the one thing I see the I think the one thing I see the offense execute the run game\u2019s offense execute the run game\u2019s got to stay real here. And got to stay real here. And that\u2019s one of the pleasant that\u2019s one of the pleasant surprises for most of the year, surprises for most of the year, is you\u2019ve been able to run the is you\u2019ve been able to run the ball. And then I think the other ball. And then I think the other thing that I just want to see thing that I just want to see going forward, and I think you going forward, and I think you would agree with this, and I\u2019ve would agree with this, and I\u2019ve said this on my podcast a lot, said this on my podcast a lot, is just got to push the ball is just got to push the ball down the field a little bit. It down the field a little bit. It can\u2019t always be an 11 play, 66 can\u2019t always be an 11 play, 66 yard drive, 12 play, 70 yard yard drive, 12 play, 70 yard drive. That\u2019s a lot. And you\u2019ll drive. That\u2019s a lot. And you\u2019ll get away with that against a lot get away with that against a lot of teams. But when you get to of teams. But when you get to the cream of the crop, the the cream of the crop, the Eagles are playoff caliber Eagles are playoff caliber football teams, right. That\u2019s football teams, right. That\u2019s where you got to have some big where you got to have some big play ability to take pressure play ability to take pressure off your offense, off your off your offense, off your rookie quarterback. So your rookie quarterback. So your offensive line doesn\u2019t have to offensive line doesn\u2019t have to protect eight out of 11 plays on protect eight out of 11 plays on a drive. And that\u2019s where I\u2019d a drive. And that\u2019s where I\u2019d like to see them improve a like to see them improve a little bit. Yeah. Get some of little bit. Yeah. Get some of those explosive backs in for those explosive backs in for sure. It\u2019s going to be sure. It\u2019s going to be interesting. They didn\u2019t have interesting. They didn\u2019t have their center last week in. Yeah their center last week in. Yeah right. That was like a last right. That was like a last second thing I think that second thing I think that impacted the run game a lot. And impacted the run game a lot. And I think if he connects on one of I think if he connects on one of those deep shots to Terry, the those deep shots to Terry, the whole conversation looks whole conversation looks different going into Philly this different going into Philly this week. All of a sudden the Eagles week. All of a sudden the Eagles look like they might steal the look like they might steal the one seed here. It\u2019s a tough one seed here. It\u2019s a tough matchup. Obviously. What is what matchup. Obviously. What is what is the way to beat Philadelphia is the way to beat Philadelphia Eagles are it\u2019s something JP and Eagles are it\u2019s something JP and I know you listen to my pod. I know you listen to my pod. Every now and then Chris Simms Every now and then Chris Simms unbuttoned like I\u2019ve been trying unbuttoned like I\u2019ve been trying to say this for about 4 or 5 to say this for about 4 or 5 weeks. I said it on Football weeks. I said it on Football Night in America about three Night in America about three weeks ago. The Eagles are the weeks ago. The Eagles are the best team in football. It might best team in football. It might not look pretty and sexy all the not look pretty and sexy all the time because they\u2019re very time because they\u2019re very simple. I mean, you watch the simple. I mean, you watch the offensive side of the ball and offensive side of the ball and that\u2019s why people in Philly were that\u2019s why people in Philly were all over Philly a little bit all over Philly a little bit because they got an all star because they got an all star team. When you really break it team. When you really break it down, you go, wait, it\u2019s the down, you go, wait, it\u2019s the best offensive line in football. best offensive line in football. It\u2019s not close. It\u2019s the best It\u2019s not close. It\u2019s the best two receivers on a team in two receivers on a team in football. You know arguably it\u2019s football. You know arguably it\u2019s up there with anybody. Waddle up there with anybody. Waddle and Tyreek Hill whoever I would and Tyreek Hill whoever I would take these guys in Philly. It\u2019s take these guys in Philly. It\u2019s the best running back in the best running back in football. It\u2019s a top ten ish football. It\u2019s a top ten ish quarterback. It\u2019s a the best quarterback. It\u2019s a the best front seven in football. And front seven in football. And there\u2019s a lot of talent in the there\u2019s a lot of talent in the back end too. They\u2019re tough to back end too. They\u2019re tough to beat, but they\u2019re very simple. beat, but they\u2019re very simple. They don\u2019t do a lot. If you They don\u2019t do a lot. If you watch them and you and I watched watch them and you and I watched film I\u2019d go look here. They run film I\u2019d go look here. They run about three run plays and here\u2019s about three run plays and here\u2019s their 7 or 8 pass plays. This is their 7 or 8 pass plays. This is all they do. But they\u2019re so good all they do. But they\u2019re so good it doesn\u2019t matter. And so you it doesn\u2019t matter. And so you have to do things a little bit have to do things a little bit out of the norm. I think you\u2019re out of the norm. I think you\u2019re going to have to take some going to have to take some tactical gambles on defense tactical gambles on defense because you just can\u2019t stop them because you just can\u2019t stop them going, oh, we\u2019ll play cover two going, oh, we\u2019ll play cover two and we won\u2019t let up the big and we won\u2019t let up the big plays on the outside. They will plays on the outside. They will run the ball down the throat run the ball down the throat down your throat with Saquon down your throat with Saquon Barkley if you try to play Barkley if you try to play coverage. And then as soon as coverage. And then as soon as you start to load the box and you start to load the box and try to stop Saquon Barkley, then try to stop Saquon Barkley, then you go oh crap, we\u2019re one on one you go oh crap, we\u2019re one on one with AJ Brown and DeVante Smith. with AJ Brown and DeVante Smith. That\u2019s a problem. So they pose That\u2019s a problem. So they pose problems for you that way. You problems for you that way. You got to disguise late. You got to got to disguise late. You got to show blitzes late. You got to show blitzes late. You got to try to catch them off guard for try to catch them off guard for what they\u2019re not expecting. And what they\u2019re not expecting. And then on the offensive side of then on the offensive side of the ball hey it\u2019s not going to the ball hey it\u2019s not going to be easy. The game plan the first be easy. The game plan the first time around was not bad. You\u2019re time around was not bad. You\u2019re going to have to kind of nickel going to have to kind of nickel and dime them five yards here and dime them five yards here eight yards here. Stay patient eight yards here. Stay patient with the run. So they can\u2019t just with the run. So they can\u2019t just think about passing the ball or think about passing the ball or rushing the passer all the time. rushing the passer all the time. And then the last piece to me is And then the last piece to me is kind of what we just talked kind of what we just talked about. Just try to find 4 or 5 about. Just try to find 4 or 5 ways that you think you could ways that you think you could take a shot down the field to take a shot down the field to back them off, take pressure off back them off, take pressure off your offense, open up some other your offense, open up some other things on your offense, and hey, things on your offense, and hey, maybe it doesn\u2019t work and you maybe it doesn\u2019t work and you don\u2019t get a completion, but at don\u2019t get a completion, but at least it\u2019ll put fear into them. least it\u2019ll put fear into them. Maybe get a pass interference. Maybe get a pass interference. And the big thing to me is just And the big thing to me is just to back them off to get the run to back them off to get the run game and the short passing game game and the short passing game to work with that. But it won\u2019t to work with that. But it won\u2019t be easy against this crew, JP it be easy against this crew, JP it won\u2019t be easy, but remember the won\u2019t be easy, but remember the Commanders had a lead at the Commanders had a lead at the beginning of the fourth quarter beginning of the fourth quarter in that game. Now, one in that game. Now, one unfortunate side effect when you unfortunate side effect when you watch those highlights back from watch those highlights back from that first Eagles game. A lot of that first Eagles game. A lot of the guys that were making plays the guys that were making plays Austin Ekeler, Noah Brown, Zach Austin Ekeler, Noah Brown, Zach Ertz, they might not be there Ertz, they might not be there this Sunday.

I think we\u2019re a team who practices we\u2019re a team who practices really hard, puts a lot of guys really hard, puts a lot of guys in different spots, so they feel in different spots, so they feel comfortable with the reps and comfortable with the reps and everything. So I think the guys everything. So I think the guys who need to step up feel great, who need to step up feel great, feel confident. It\u2019s all just feel confident. It\u2019s all just about getting those reps, about getting those reps, working with Jaden, see what he working with Jaden, see what he wants, seeing what Coach wants, seeing what Coach Kingsbury wants and just getting Kingsbury wants and just getting that right before we get there, that right before we get there, do you feel like you could be do you feel like you could be one of those guys? You think one of those guys? You think maybe increased snaps increase maybe increased snaps increase targets? Could that be a result targets? Could that be a result here? Yeah, maybe. I think just here? Yeah, maybe. I think just losing a guy and other guys losing a guy and other guys always just have to step up and always just have to step up and try to fill that role and fill try to fill that role and fill those gaps, because obviously those gaps, because obviously he\u2019s a huge part of our offense. he\u2019s a huge part of our offense. So I mean, just I\u2019ll be ready So I mean, just I\u2019ll be ready for whenever my number is called for whenever my number is called and take advantage of the and take advantage of the opportunities. The rookie opportunities. The rookie telling the truth there, Noah telling the truth there, Noah Brown has been a big part of Brown has been a big part of this Washington offense. And this Washington offense. And when you consider that Brown is when you consider that Brown is out and Ekeler is out, at least out and Ekeler is out, at least for the foreseeable future, for the foreseeable future, maybe one or both of these guys maybe one or both of these guys can come back, but they\u2019re can come back, but they\u2019re certainly not playing the next certainly not playing the next few weeks. It\u2019s alarming for a few weeks. It\u2019s alarming for a Washington offense that\u2019s over Washington offense that\u2019s over 1000 yards of production that is 1000 yards of production that is just not available anymore. I do just not available anymore. I do like Senate as a potential guy like Senate as a potential guy to step up here. He\u2019s got to get to step up here. He\u2019s got to get a few more snaps. They\u2019ve got to a few more snaps. They\u2019ve got to figure out what they want to do figure out what they want to do in those two tight end sets. in those two tight end sets. Maybe Senate gets on the field a Maybe Senate gets on the field a little bit more instead of John little bit more instead of John Bates. They\u2019re going to keep Bates. They\u2019re going to keep Zach Ertz out there because he\u2019s Zach Ertz out there because he\u2019s just so sure handed and such a just so sure handed and such a good route runner. It\u2019s going to good route runner. It\u2019s going to be fascinating to watch. Keep in be fascinating to watch. Keep in mind the Commanders also signed mind the Commanders also signed K.J. Osborn claimed him off K.J. Osborn claimed him off waivers. So Osborn is going to waivers. So Osborn is going to be on the active roster. Osborn be on the active roster. Osborn is a guy that really has helped is a guy that really has helped a football team before when he a football team before when he was with the Vikings. Keep this was with the Vikings. Keep this in mind, he had seasons of 655, in mind, he had seasons of 655, 650 and 540 yards. That\u2019s that\u2019s 650 and 540 yards. That\u2019s that\u2019s real production for NFL wide real production for NFL wide receivers. He also was good at receivers. He also was good at finding the red zone when he was finding the red zone when he was connected with Kirk in connected with Kirk in Minnesota. This year in New Minnesota.

He\u2019s a coach is right now. He\u2019s a Jersey guy, as Heather McDonough Jersey guy, as Heather McDonough likes to point out. And man, likes to point out. And man, he\u2019s impressed by Jayden he\u2019s impressed by Jayden Daniels. Extremely impressive. I Daniels. Extremely impressive. I mean, the most impressive thing mean, the most impressive thing about about Jayden Daniels right about about Jayden Daniels right now is the fact that for a now is the fact that for a rookie, he\u2019s got a 70% rookie, he\u2019s got a 70% completion percentage and a guy completion percentage and a guy that\u2019s I think I think he\u2019s the that\u2019s I think I think he\u2019s the third in the league in the least third in the league in the least amount of turnovers for a amount of turnovers for a quarterback. And those are quarterback.

I know that the Washington Scouts front office, Washington Scouts front office, the coaches watched Seibert kick the coaches watched Seibert kick last week and they thought he last week and they thought he was good to go. And then was good to go. And then sometime in that game, or maybe sometime in that game, or maybe it was after he injured his it was after he injured his groin on top of the hip problem groin on top of the hip problem he already had. You don\u2019t want he already had. You don\u2019t want to put any one game, any one win to put any one game, any one win or loss on any one single or loss on any one single player. This one might seem easy player. This one might seem easy to put it on. Seibert. I still to put it on. Seibert. I still think that\u2019s unfair, but man, think that\u2019s unfair, but man, missing two extra points is missing two extra points is really, really hard to do. And really, really hard to do. And it\u2019s tough when Dan Quinn later it\u2019s tough when Dan Quinn later says, yeah, you know, kicking it says, yeah, you know, kicking it out of the end zone is really out of the end zone is really hard for a lot of teams that hard for a lot of teams that isn\u2019t. You made a choice to go isn\u2019t. You made a choice to go with Seibert because he was so with Seibert because he was so sure footed. If that\u2019s a word sure footed. If that\u2019s a word from inside a 50. And with that from inside a 50. And with that you took a little less distance you took a little less distance on your kickoffs. Maybe, just on your kickoffs. Maybe, just maybe, it came back to bite you. maybe, it came back to bite you. But fans got to keep in mind Dan But fans got to keep in mind Dan Quinn\u2019s not lying when he says Quinn\u2019s not lying when he says he loves his coverage teams. he loves his coverage teams. They might have called the dirty They might have called the dirty kick and asked for a Kavontae kick and asked for a Kavontae Turpin return. No matter who was Turpin return. No matter who was kicking. Now, maybe that\u2019s a kicking. Now, maybe that\u2019s a little crazy, but it\u2019s entirely little crazy, but it\u2019s entirely possible that\u2019s what they would possible that\u2019s what they would have been doing anyway. That was have been doing anyway. That was then. This is now. Seibert is then. This is now. Seibert is now on the air. It\u2019s a little up now on the air. It\u2019s a little up in the air. If we even see him in the air. If we even see him again this year, it\u2019s going to again this year, it\u2019s going to be Zane Gonzalez kicking this be Zane Gonzalez kicking this week. Now speaking of this week, week. Now speaking of this week, Washington has lost three in a Washington has lost three in a row. You guys know that already. row. You guys know that already. You lose to the Steelers the You lose to the Steelers the Eagles and then the Cowboys. Eagles and then the Cowboys. Things are not quite reeling. Things are not quite reeling. But they\u2019re not exactly smooth But they\u2019re not exactly smooth sailing either. I asked DQ how sailing either. I asked DQ how do you get this thing going do you get this thing going again? You\u2019ve talked throughout again? You\u2019ve talked throughout about how you take everything about how you take everything week by week by week, and week by week by week, and there\u2019s a plan. Does any of that there\u2019s a plan. Does any of that planning or urgency or any of planning or urgency or any of that change? After three that change? After three straight losses for the myself, straight losses for the myself, there\u2019s always a bigger picture there\u2019s always a bigger picture of things. What\u2019s a trend and of things. What\u2019s a trend and where do you want to go? And where do you want to go? And I\u2019ll express that to the staff I\u2019ll express that to the staff and to the team. But you do dig and to the team. But you do dig into the team and then you into the team and then you emphasize the things that you emphasize the things that you want to work on this time right want to work on this time right now. And so you don\u2019t pick 15 now. And so you don\u2019t pick 15 different things to work in one different things to work in one week of practice. This is week of practice. This is something you want to improve something you want to improve on. Let\u2019s put the work in to do on. Let\u2019s put the work in to do that. So after three losses it\u2019s that. So after three losses it\u2019s challenging. It\u2019s the most challenging. It\u2019s the most challenged we\u2019ve been so far is challenged we\u2019ve been so far is confusing, frustrating all of confusing, frustrating all of those things. That\u2019s also part those things. That\u2019s also part of competing and knowing how to of competing and knowing how to handle those emotions and dig in handle those emotions and dig in on the things that you need to on the things that you need to dig in on. And that\u2019s what we dig in on. And that\u2019s what we intend to do, whether it\u2019s real intend to do, whether it\u2019s real or just perception, DQ is doing or just perception, DQ is doing a good job of having a grasp on a good job of having a grasp on exactly where this team is, yet exactly where this team is, yet also being honest, confusing, also being honest, confusing, challenging and frustrating. challenging and frustrating. That\u2019s how fans feel. Clearly, That\u2019s how fans feel. Clearly, it\u2019s how Dan Quinn feels too. it\u2019s how Dan Quinn feels too. Now for this team to get things Now for this team to get things back together. Let\u2019s look at back together. Let\u2019s look at what they\u2019re saying and a big what they\u2019re saying and a big part of what people are saying part of what people are saying is about Kliff Kingsbury and is about Kliff Kingsbury and this offense. Well, we asked a this offense. Well, we asked a bunch of players, how do you get bunch of players, how do you get it going again? I mean, you just it going again? I mean, you just go out there and play football, go out there and play football, execute and let the cards fall execute and let the cards fall where they fall. It\u2019s just how where they fall. It\u2019s just how we prepare and go out there, we prepare and go out there, have fun and play loose and you have fun and play loose and you know we\u2019ll live with the know we\u2019ll live with the outcomes. I think the sense of outcomes. I think the sense of urgency is, is there? I think urgency is, is there? I think it\u2019s been there. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been there. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve lost that. I just think it we\u2019ve lost that. I just think it comes down to like executing. comes down to like executing. When we get out there on Sunday. When we get out there on Sunday. So, I mean, I think the urgency So, I mean, I think the urgency has definitely been there. We has definitely been there. We had a great week of practice had a great week of practice last week, but we just didn\u2019t last week, but we just didn\u2019t execute on the field. And that\u2019s execute on the field. And that\u2019s what really matters. But the what really matters. But the good thing about it is we good thing about it is we haven\u2019t had to like, turn up the haven\u2019t had to like, turn up the urgency or like have a come to urgency or like have a come to Jesus meeting or anything like Jesus meeting or anything like that. It\u2019s just continue to that. It\u2019s just continue to trust the process and putting trust the process and putting the work in. But executing on the work in. But executing on Sunday is really the key. Yeah, Sunday is really the key. Yeah, I definitely think there\u2019s not a I definitely think there\u2019s not a sense of panic at all. You know? sense of panic at all. You know? I mean, I don\u2019t think there I mean, I don\u2019t think there hasn\u2019t been any big changes to hasn\u2019t been any big changes to the roster or, you know, the roster or, you know, somebody is playing over somebody is playing over somebody else or we need to make somebody else or we need to make some big move. I just think it\u2019s some big move. I just think it\u2019s about executing better on about executing better on Sunday. And, you know, the Sunday. And, you know, the practices have been really practices have been really strong. A lot of energy, which I strong. A lot of energy, which I think that was the biggest thing think that was the biggest thing that we just wanted to focus on that we just wanted to focus on making sure our energy is right, making sure our energy is right, because when you come off of because when you come off of three tough losses like that three tough losses like that human nature can can be just to human nature can can be just to feel sorry for yourself. And, feel sorry for yourself. And, you know, they\u2019re physical. They you know, they\u2019re physical. They were physical games as well. But were physical games as well. But we don\u2019t have that that kind of we don\u2019t have that that kind of mindset in this locker room, mindset in this locker room, which is really refreshing when which is really refreshing when you have a lot of leaders who\u2019ve you have a lot of leaders who\u2019ve been around the league for so been around the league for so long. It helps to keep long. It helps to keep perspective. So we\u2019re looking perspective. So we\u2019re looking forward to trying to turn things forward to trying to turn things around this Sunday. I\u2019ve been in around this Sunday. I\u2019ve been in the locker room for every year the locker room for every year of Terry Mclaurin\u2019s career, of Terry Mclaurin\u2019s career, actually, as my hairline will actually, as my hairline will show you, I\u2019ve been in that show you, I\u2019ve been in that locker room for years. Prior to locker room for years. Prior to Terry Mclaurin\u2019s NFL career. But Terry Mclaurin\u2019s NFL career. But I do believe when he says what I do believe when he says what we have in that locker room is we have in that locker room is going to be able to respond and going to be able to respond and that we don\u2019t need to change that we don\u2019t need to change anything. We just need to anything. We just need to execute. Now that is what execute. Now that is what players have to believe. Go out players have to believe. Go out there, do your job, do your best there, do your job, do your best and it\u2019s going to work out. But and it\u2019s going to work out. But then some questions start about then some questions start about schematic issues. Specifically, schematic issues. Specifically, Terry McLaurin is undoubtedly Terry McLaurin is undoubtedly Washington\u2019s best wide receiver, Washington\u2019s best wide receiver, so you\u2019d want to move him so you\u2019d want to move him around, right? Well, as of right around, right? Well, as of right now, Kliff Kingsbury is not now, Kliff Kingsbury is not doing that very much. Most of doing that very much. Most of the time, something like 75, 80% the time, something like 75, 80% of the time. Terry McLaurin of the time. Terry McLaurin lines up on the left side of the lines up on the left side of the offense. Dan Quinn explained. offense. Dan Quinn explained. Hey, lots of offenses do it that Hey, lots of offenses do it that way. In fact, when Peyton way. In fact, when Peyton Manning was running the Colts at Manning was running the Colts at such a high level, Marvin such a high level, Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne were Harrison and Reggie Wayne were on the same side of the field on the same side of the field almost every snap. But that almost every snap. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the way it has doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the way it has to be. So I asked Terry Terry to be. So I asked Terry Terry earlier today, DQ was talking earlier today, DQ was talking about how different offenses about how different offenses play their receivers play their receivers differently, and he talked about differently, and he talked about those Colts teams you grew up those Colts teams you grew up loving, how how Marvin and loving, how how Marvin and Reggie were primarily just Reggie were primarily just played one side of the field. played one side of the field. But sometimes you have to move But sometimes you have to move it around. How does it impact it around. How does it impact your game to line up just on one your game to line up just on one side of the field or to be moved side of the field or to be moved around? Yeah, I mean, I think around? Yeah, I mean, I think I\u2019m the type of receiver where I I\u2019m the type of receiver where I just, I feel like I could play just, I feel like I could play all the positions left side, all the positions left side, right side slot, and I just try right side slot, and I just try to control what I can and, and to control what I can and, and be a very effective wherever be a very effective wherever they place me and you know, I they place me and you know, I trust that they\u2019re going to try trust that they\u2019re going to try to put me in the best situation to put me in the best situation to be successful. You know, they to be successful. You know, they are always in communication of are always in communication of things that I may like to run things that I may like to run this week or some things that this week or some things that I\u2019m seeing on game day. So the I\u2019m seeing on game day. So the communication is there. But from communication is there. But from my perspective, I just got to my perspective, I just got to focus on wherever they put me focus on wherever they put me left right slot. I\u2019m being the left right slot. I\u2019m being the best version of myself. So, you best version of myself. So, you know, I feel like I\u2019m doing a know, I feel like I\u2019m doing a pretty good job, but I think I pretty good job, but I think I could still continue to improve. could still continue to improve. So if that means me moving to So if that means me moving to the right or moving in the slot the right or moving in the slot wherever they put me, I feel wherever they put me, I feel like I could be effective to try like I could be effective to try to help the team. I think that\u2019s to help the team. I think that\u2019s just my main focus. Always just my main focus. Always trying to let them know that trying to let them know that anything they want me to do, I\u2019m anything they want me to do, I\u2019m willing to do it, and I feel willing to do it, and I feel like I could do it at a high like I could do it at a high level. So I think that\u2019s, you level. So I think that\u2019s, you know, the system that we\u2019re in know, the system that we\u2019re in and, you know, my job is just to and, you know, my job is just to execute wherever they put me. execute wherever they put me. Terry\u2019s always going to say the Terry\u2019s always going to say the right thing. Now we\u2019re going to right thing. Now we\u2019re going to touch on this a little later in touch on this a little later in the mailbag portion. What they the mailbag portion. What they actually could do and what some actually could do and what some of the numbers reveal. But I do of the numbers reveal.

They were really bad last year and they I write a bad last year and they I write a lot of people want to talk about lot of people want to talk about Kliff Kingsbury and this offense Kliff Kingsbury and this offense kind of falling apart, but I kind of falling apart, but I don\u2019t know how much they\u2019ve don\u2019t know how much they\u2019ve fallen apart, rather just they fallen apart, rather just they were at an exceptional high were at an exceptional high level. And it\u2019s kind of getting level. And it\u2019s kind of getting back towards the mid. I just I back towards the mid. I just I don\u2019t I think everybody\u2019s got to don\u2019t I think everybody\u2019s got to take a deep breath. They\u2019re take a deep breath. They\u2019re already at seven wins. They\u2019re already at seven wins. They\u2019re going to finish the season at going to finish the season at least with nine. I would say least with nine. I would say they\u2019re probably still a playoff they\u2019re probably still a playoff team if you just believe the team if you just believe the numbers. I\u2019m absolutely not on numbers. I\u2019m absolutely not on the hot seat. Were the the hot seat. Were the Commanders supposed to be this Commanders supposed to be this good? Do you think at the good? Do you think at the beginning of the season nobody beginning of the season nobody thought so? And then Jayden thought so? And then Jayden Daniels shows up. They had a Daniels shows up. They had a brand new offense. They were brand new offense. They were doing things nobody expected or doing things nobody expected or saw coming. So then the saw coming. So then the expectations got sky high and we expectations got sky high and we got to kind of level set a got to kind of level set a little bit. I think for all the little bit. I think for all the talk about Kingsbury, people got talk about Kingsbury, people got to relax. You really can\u2019t to relax. You really can\u2019t compare what happened in compare what happened in Arizona. You had a hurt Arizona. You had a hurt quarterback, was a big part of quarterback, was a big part of those second half collapses with those second half collapses with the Cardinals different teams, the Cardinals different teams, different eras, different different eras, different everything. Now we get to number everything. Now we get to number two. Questioned by Bill. Will two. Questioned by Bill. Will they start moving Terry around they start moving Terry around and feeding him the ball more? and feeding him the ball more? You did talk about this a little You did talk about this a little bit at the beginning of the bit at the beginning of the show. He is the lowest targeted show. He is the lowest targeted top ten wide receiver in the top ten wide receiver in the NFL. Yeah it\u2019s remarkable, NFL. Yeah it\u2019s remarkable, especially if you look at the especially if you look at the targets to the catches to the targets to the catches to the yards where he ranks top five yards where he ranks top five and the targets are low. And and the targets are low. And think about that\u2019s an extra think about that\u2019s an extra game. Most of these other teams game. Most of these other teams have already had their bye. So have already had their bye. So it\u2019s remarkable how productive it\u2019s remarkable how productive Terry has been. That is a Terry has been. That is a testament to how good Jayden has testament to how good Jayden has been and what Terry is able to been and what Terry is able to accomplish. The ultimate accomplish. The ultimate question about moving him around question about moving him around more. My answer is yes, and I more. My answer is yes, and I think move. You can talk about think move. You can talk about feeding him the ball. That\u2019s feeding him the ball. That\u2019s fine. But if defenses are a fine. But if defenses are a little less adamant to know, little less adamant to know, okay, he\u2019s going to be on the okay, he\u2019s going to be on the left side every single snap. left side every single snap. Sometimes it\u2019s just going to get Sometimes it\u2019s just going to get bogged down. And when you do bogged down. And when you do move him around, you couldn\u2019t move him around, you couldn\u2019t help but notice the 86 yard help but notice the 86 yard touchdown pass against the touchdown pass against the Cowboys. You know where he was Cowboys. You know where he was on the right side. And Terry has on the right side. And Terry has talked about how he loves how talked about how he loves how versatile he is as a player. How versatile he is as a player. How hard he\u2019s worked to be able to hard he\u2019s worked to be able to play any of those positions left play any of those positions left right in the slot wherever you right in the slot wherever you want him. I think Terry will want him. I think Terry will never say something bad. He\u2019ll never say something bad. He\u2019ll never question his coaches. My never question his coaches. My guess. My gut tells me Terry guess. My gut tells me Terry would like to be a little bit would like to be a little bit more versatile. Okay, now on to more versatile. Okay, now on to number three. By Tommy Welch. It number three. By Tommy Welch. It seems like a lot of fans, Tommy, seems like a lot of fans, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy split right now due Tommy, Tommy split right now due to differing expectations. Some to differing expectations. Some are content with where the team are content with where the team is, others feel they\u2019re is, others feel they\u2019re underperforming. Given the underperforming. Given the current losing streak, where do current losing streak, where do you JP Finlay stand? I think you you JP Finlay stand? I think you should be content because should be content because they\u2019ve got seven wins already. they\u2019ve got seven wins already. The underperformance, I\u2019ll allow The underperformance, I\u2019ll allow that because of the loss to the that because of the loss to the Cowboys. I think in the second Cowboys. I think in the second half, Dallas started to play half, Dallas started to play some pretty good football in the some pretty good football in the first half of that game. Dallas first half of that game. Dallas was begging Washington to take was begging Washington to take control. They begged them, if control. They begged them, if you look at the field position, you look at the field position, if you look at just the if you look at just the turnovers, the blocked field turnovers, the blocked field goal, the missed field goal, goal, the missed field goal, Dallas begged Washington to get Dallas begged Washington to get out to a 20 to nothing lead and out to a 20 to nothing lead and put them out of their misery. put them out of their misery. And the Commanders offense was And the Commanders offense was completely incapable of doing completely incapable of doing it. And I think then you tackle it. And I think then you tackle on some special teams problems. on some special teams problems. The only real game I\u2019ve seen The only real game I\u2019ve seen underperformance. If you look at underperformance. If you look at the losses, go back to Tampa the losses, go back to Tampa week one. That was Jayden week one. That was Jayden getting his eyes used to NFL getting his eyes used to NFL speed, right? And then you fast speed, right? And then you fast forward throughout the few forward throughout the few losses. Philly on a Thursday losses. Philly on a Thursday night. The four of those five night. The four of those five losses I can understand going to losses I can understand going to Baltimore for what is just a Baltimore for what is just a freight train of an offense, freight train of an offense, right? That Cowboys loss at home right? That Cowboys loss at home on ten days rest. That\u2019s the on ten days rest. That\u2019s the first one. That\u2019s like all right first one. That\u2019s like all right we got a we got some questions. we got a we got some questions. And I think I think that\u2019s fair And I think I think that\u2019s fair I don\u2019t know I still think you I don\u2019t know I still think you could be content with where they could be content with where they are on the season.

And you saw the Cowboys coming to town and Cowboys coming to town and you\u2019re like over 27.5. You know you\u2019re like over 27.5. You know I think Vegas money Vegas was 20 I think Vegas money Vegas was 20 Vegas was watching this show. Vegas was watching this show. And they were like, hey, we need And they were like, hey, we need to go talk to the kicker. We to go talk to the kicker. We need to we need to miss two need to we need to miss two extra points just so we could extra points just so we could get on his bad side. That\u2019s all get on his bad side. That\u2019s all it was. Two missed extra points it was. Two missed extra points and a missed field goal. We\u2019re and a missed field goal. We\u2019re right there. We\u2019re right there. right there. We\u2019re right there. If he hits the two extra points, If he hits the two extra points, that\u2019s it. Listen, some people that\u2019s it. Listen, some people call it the Yurdu theory. Some call it the Yurdu theory. Some people call it the gambler\u2019s people call it the gambler\u2019s fallacy. Whatever you call it, I fallacy. Whatever you call it, I think you are due, sir. That is think you are due, sir. That is heartbreak City. I mean, the heartbreak City. I mean, the kicker missed two extra points kicker missed two extra points and a field goal and you needed and a field goal and you needed two points. That\u2019s all we two points. That\u2019s all we needed. That\u2019s all we needed. needed. That\u2019s all we needed. All right, so let\u2019s look at this All right, so let\u2019s look at this weekend\u2019s line. The Titans are weekend\u2019s line. The Titans are coming to town. The you know the coming to town. The you know the Titans haven\u2019t won two in a row Titans haven\u2019t won two in a row in two years. The Titans defense in two years. The Titans defense is pretty good. This offense is is pretty good. This offense is abysmal. Now it\u2019s Wednesday abysmal. Now it\u2019s Wednesday night. These odds are powered by night. These odds are powered by DraftKings. The Commanders are DraftKings. The Commanders are favored by five and a half over favored by five and a half over under a 44.5. Is that your prop? under a 44.5. Is that your prop? We got a prop in here. Hey, We got a prop in here. Hey, Washington has been doing great Washington has been doing great in the first half. They\u2019ve only in the first half. They\u2019ve only trailed three times so far this trailed three times so far this season, 3 to 3. Last week at season, 3 to 3. Last week at halftime it was 3 to 3. That\u2019s halftime it was 3 to 3. That\u2019s the only time they they trailed the only time they they trailed the Ravens. Who else was it. Two the Ravens. Who else was it. Two other teams. They\u2019ve trailed any other teams. They\u2019ve trailed any other time. They\u2019re up big at other time. They\u2019re up big at the half. So I\u2019m thinking the half. So I\u2019m thinking they\u2019re up by at least four they\u2019re up by at least four points at the half plus 102 I points at the half plus 102 I think I can do it. I don\u2019t think think I can do it. I don\u2019t think Tennessee I don\u2019t think back to Tennessee I don\u2019t think back to back track buddy. We will be back track buddy. We will be keeping track. Tennessee plays keeping track. Tennessee plays good defense, but Washington\u2019s good defense, but Washington\u2019s offense has to get on track at offense has to get on track at some point. Right. It looks it some point. Right. It looks it looks like Brian Robinson will looks like Brian Robinson will play. We\u2019ll see if that comes to play. We\u2019ll see if that comes to fruition. I don\u2019t expect Ekeler fruition. I don\u2019t expect Ekeler to play dealing with to play dealing with concussions. It looks like concussions. It looks like Andrew Wylie is going to be out. Andrew Wylie is going to be out. What they really need is Jayden What they really need is Jayden Daniels. Get back on track Daniels. Get back on track right. If Jayden Daniels can be right. If Jayden Daniels can be the same player he\u2019s been and we the same player he\u2019s been and we saw it with his legs and then we saw it with his legs and then we saw it late against the Cowboys, saw it late against the Cowboys, I want you to know I\u2019m rooting I want you to know I\u2019m rooting for you sincerely. If you\u2019re for you sincerely. If you\u2019re using these bets at home I owe using these bets at home I owe you. Tell everybody about your you. Tell everybody about your sweater. That\u2019s dope.
