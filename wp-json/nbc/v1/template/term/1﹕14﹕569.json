The city frustrating and unfair. The city just restarted a pilot program just restarted a pilot program aimed at helping the I-Team aimed at helping the I-Team tracked the city\u2019s first efforts tracked the city\u2019s first efforts in that program, and found out in that program, and found out it cost DC Taxpayers more than it cost DC Taxpayers more than 600.

Max used a wheelchair since she was ten, wheelchair since she was ten, moved to DC after college, she moved to DC after college, she tells us, because our city was tells us, because our city was trying to be more accessible. trying to be more accessible. Are they keeping the promise? So Are they keeping the promise? So here and there? It\u2019s not exactly here and there? It\u2019s not exactly the city\u2019s motto. It\u2019s hard. DC the city\u2019s motto. It\u2019s hard. DC Has a few options for passengers Has a few options for passengers with wheelchairs. Metro is with wheelchairs. Metro is accessible. Metro access works, accessible. Metro access works, too, but requires setting up too, but requires setting up rides days in advance and being rides days in advance and being willing to wait. The transport willing to wait. The transport DC Program offers subsidized DC Program offers subsidized taxi rides, but only within the taxi rides, but only within the district. The district doesn\u2019t district. The district doesn\u2019t require rideshare companies like require rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft to have wheelchair Uber and Lyft to have wheelchair accessible vehicles, and they accessible vehicles, and they account for 95% of all the for account for 95% of all the for hire rides here, which leaves hire rides here, which leaves taxis. They make up just 5% of taxis. They make up just 5% of all the for hire trips in DC Did all the for hire trips in DC Did they have someone? They didn\u2019t they have someone? They didn\u2019t have anyone yet. Taxis are have anyone yet. Taxis are district regulated and provided district regulated and provided 23,000 trips for people who use 23,000 trips for people who use wheelchairs last year. Riders wheelchairs last year. Riders like Kelly tell us wheelchair like Kelly tell us wheelchair accessible taxis are not exactly accessible taxis are not exactly plentiful when you need one. I plentiful when you need one. I call it the Yeti because it\u2019s call it the Yeti because it\u2019s rumored to exist, but you know, rumored to exist, but you know, I rarely ever see it. Which is I rarely ever see it. Which is why the district, with every why the district, with every good intention, has tried to good intention, has tried to increase service. DC Has a law increase service. DC Has a law mandating 20% of large cab mandating 20% of large cab fleets have to be wheelchair fleets have to be wheelchair accessible, but the I-Team accessible, but the I-Team couldn\u2019t find that it\u2019s ever couldn\u2019t find that it\u2019s ever been enforced. And the head of been enforced. And the head of the department with oversight the department with oversight told us we can\u2019t punish them told us we can\u2019t punish them into compliance. There really, into compliance. There really, really needs to be progress. really needs to be progress. Naomi Hesse was hopeful last Naomi Hesse was hopeful last year when DC Set aside 500,000 year when DC Set aside 500,000 more of your dollars to more of your dollars to incentivize cab drivers to incentivize cab drivers to operate wheelchair accessible operate wheelchair accessible vehicles, paying those drivers vehicles, paying those drivers more per hour or to work late more per hour or to work late hours. The city even set up a hours. The city even set up a hotline for people to get hotline for people to get connected. I tried that pilot connected. I tried that pilot line multiple times and they line multiple times and they just couldn\u2019t find one for me. just couldn\u2019t find one for me. Where is the money going? The Where is the money going? The district spent $255,000 in that district spent $255,000 in that pilot program, which generated pilot program, which generated 435 wheelchair taxi trips over 435 wheelchair taxi trips over six months. That\u2019s $586.21 per six months. That\u2019s $586.21 per ride. Not exactly a return on ride. Not exactly a return on investment to brag about. investment to brag about. Jonathan Rogers, the director of Jonathan Rogers, the director of DC\u2019s Department of for hire DC\u2019s Department of for hire vehicles, which spearheaded the vehicles, which spearheaded the pilot, wouldn\u2019t talk to us on pilot, wouldn\u2019t talk to us on camera, but he told the I-Team camera, but he told the I-Team Council, encouraged us to Council, encouraged us to experiment and figure out what experiment and figure out what would change behavior. So that\u2019s would change behavior. So that\u2019s what we did. He said he hoped it what we did. He said he hoped it would build momentum and that would build momentum and that the six new drivers added to the the six new drivers added to the program would stick with it. program would stick with it. Anyone without a wheelchair can Anyone without a wheelchair can get an Uber, Lyft or taxi get an Uber, Lyft or taxi whenever they want. It\u2019s just whenever they want. It\u2019s just not fair. Last fall, Naomi Hesse not fair. Last fall, Naomi Hesse had all her travel planned out had all her travel planned out so she could attend the Sabrina so she could attend the Sabrina Carpenter concert in Baltimore, Carpenter concert in Baltimore, but a delayed Amtrak train got but a delayed Amtrak train got her to Union Station at one in her to Union Station at one in the morning, leaving her with the morning, leaving her with few options.

It isn\u2019t like this everywhere in New York like this everywhere in New York City, there are more than 12,000 City, there are more than 12,000 wheelchair accessible taxis and wheelchair accessible taxis and rideshare vehicles. That city rideshare vehicles. That city says 46% of their taxi fleet is says 46% of their taxi fleet is wheelchair accessible. And by wheelchair accessible. And by law, anyone who now wants to law, anyone who now wants to start driving for a rideshare start driving for a rideshare company there must use an company there must use an accessible vehicle. Here in D.C, accessible vehicle. Here in D.C, Uber has a few, but didn\u2019t Uber has a few, but didn\u2019t respond to any of our questions respond to any of our questions about wheelchair vehicles. Lyft about wheelchair vehicles. Lyft has none in D.C, but does offer has none in D.C, but does offer them in nine other cities. They them in nine other cities. They told the I-Team it will continue told the I-Team it will continue to push for solutions that make to push for solutions that make rideshare as accessible as rideshare as accessible as possible for everyone. This one possible for everyone. This one needs a transmission. This one needs a transmission. This one needs a transmission. As for needs a transmission. As for taxis, none of the larger taxis, none of the larger companies in town would talk to companies in town would talk to us on camera, but did admit it us on camera, but did admit it is a challenge saying wheelchair is a challenge saying wheelchair accessible taxis are both accessible taxis are both expensive to buy and costly to expensive to buy and costly to maintain due mostly to their maintain due mostly to their weight and modifications, which weight and modifications, which could explain why we found so could explain why we found so many in their lots. Do you have many in their lots. Do you have an estimated time for riders an estimated time for riders like Kelly Mack, who just wants like Kelly Mack, who just wants to get to the store?
