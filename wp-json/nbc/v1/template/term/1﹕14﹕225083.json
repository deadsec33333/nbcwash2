Wiggins says while the path seems more challenging the path seems more challenging than ever, he is encouraging than ever, he is encouraging business owners to stay the business owners to stay the course. I don\u2019t think you should course. I don\u2019t think you should give up. I think a minority give up. I think a minority business contractor should stay business contractor should stay as a contractor. I think pivot as a contractor. I think pivot is the word of the day, the is the word of the day, the hour, the week and the month. hour, the week and the month. For now, these Northern Virginia For now, these Northern Virginia business owners are trying to business owners are trying to figure out what that looks like figure out what that looks like together, possibly without together, possibly without government work. How can we help government work. How can we help each other survive? New each other survive? New unemployment figures out of unemployment figures out of Virginia this week gave us a Virginia this week gave us a glimpse of how Trump\u2019s cuts are glimpse of how Trump\u2019s cuts are impacting local jobs. More than impacting local jobs. More than 4000 unemployment insurance 4000 unemployment insurance claims were filed for the week claims were filed for the week of March 8th. That\u2019s 80% higher of March 8th. That\u2019s 80% higher than the same time last year. than the same time last year. And keep in mind, while those And keep in mind, while those numbers may cover some federal numbers may cover some federal contractors, independent contractors, independent contractors like Ramona Antoine contractors like Ramona Antoine can collect unemployment because can collect unemployment because they don\u2019t pay into that system. they don\u2019t pay into that system. So let me ask you, I heard the So let me ask you, I heard the word pivot used in in one of word pivot used in in one of those interviews. What do some those interviews. What do some of these business owners plan on of these business owners plan on doing? Will they completely doing? Will they completely pivot to something else, a pivot to something else, a completely different field, or completely different field, or what is what is the next idea what is what is the next idea for them? So they\u2019re trying to for them? So they\u2019re trying to figure that out, right. And I figure that out, right. And I think Antoine is a great example think Antoine is a great example of this, that she had a number of this, that she had a number of contracts, but the big money of contracts, but the big money came from the federal government came from the federal government contracts that she had. So when contracts that she had. So when they\u2019re talking about pivot, they\u2019re talking about pivot, they\u2019re talking about how can we they\u2019re talking about how can we build something within our build something within our community to sustain us where we community to sustain us where we are not looking for a check that are not looking for a check that may not be coming? This is may not be coming? This is something that we heard a lot of something that we heard a lot of conservatives talking about, conservatives talking about, talking about moving away from talking about moving away from government dependability. And government dependability. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here with a lot of these folks. But with a lot of these folks. But families having very tough families having very tough conversations, like Antoine is conversations, like Antoine is having with her kids about having with her kids about mommy\u2019s business that she worked mommy\u2019s business that she worked so hard to build is not what we so hard to build is not what we thought it was going to be. Now thought it was going to be. Now we have to figure things out, we have to figure things out, and it\u2019s just really tough for a and it\u2019s just really tough for a lot of these families right now.","video_id":"2415938115594","video_length":"417284","video_provider":"mpx","short_video_excerpt":"","show":"","event":"","genre":"","mpx_download_pid_mobile_low":"_aLcVHrinLqG","pid_streaming_web_mobile_low":"","mpx_download_pid_mobile_standard":"58qE2oe4OK05","pid_streaming_mobile_standard":"qffSZWPCNTMO","media_pid":"YTHH2s9fZhVe","alleypack_schedule_unpublish":"","footnotes":"","feed_remote_id":"mpx_2415938115594","feed_thumbnail_url":""},"category_names":{"225083":"Investigations"},"tag_names":{"4744":"News4 I-Team","839":"Trump administration"},"custom_data":{"ContentPartner":"None","Source":"NBC","SyndicationAllowed":"true","mSNVideoCategories":"MSN Video v4 Connector-most watched news","mSNVideoContentSupplierID":"NBC_Local","mSNVideoCountry":"us","subtitle":"nosubtitle","uploadedByTeam":"1","youtubeChannel":"None","sentiment":"Neutral","topic":"Politics"},"title":"Black federal contractors feel impact of spending cuts","url":"https:\/\/www.nbcwashington.com\/investigations\/black-federal-contractors-feel-impact-of-spending-cuts\/3872811\/"},"share_links":{"facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcwashington.com%2Finvestigations%2Fblack-owned-government-contracting-firms-fear-gains-will-be-lost-amid-trump-spending-cuts%2F3873660%2F&amp;Black-owned%20government%20contracting%20firms%20fear%20gains%20will%20be%20lost%20amid%20Trump%20spending%20cuts","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=Black-owned%20government%20contracting%20firms%20fear%20gains%20will%20be%20lost%20amid%20Trump%20spending%20cuts&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcwashington.com%2Finvestigations%2Fblack-owned-government-contracting-firms-fear-gains-will-be-lost-amid-trump-spending-cuts%2F3873660%2F","email":"mailto:?body=Black-owned%20government%20contracting%20firms%20fear%20gains%20will%20be%20lost%20amid%20Trump%20spending%20cuts%0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcwashington.com%2Finvestigations%2Fblack-owned-government-contracting-firms-fear-gains-will-be-lost-amid-trump-spending-cuts%2F3873660%2F","native":"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcwashington.com%2Finvestigations%2Fblack-owned-government-contracting-firms-fear-gains-will-be-lost-amid-trump-spending-cuts%2F3873660%2F"},"bylines":[{"description":"<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Tracee Wilkins is an investigative reporter with the News4 I-Team.&nbsp;She has won an Edward R.

His wife wouldn\u2019t open the off. His wife wouldn\u2019t open the door. We don\u2019t have any reason door.

None have current pending None have current pending criminal charges. So why the criminal charges. So why the early morning operations? You early morning operations? You know, most of our our targets know, most of our our targets work early in the morning, work early in the morning, arresting someone when they\u2019re arresting someone when they\u2019re half asleep at 5:00 in the half asleep at 5:00 in the morning is less. There\u2019s morning is less. There\u2019s statistically there\u2019s less statistically there\u2019s less likelihood that they are going likelihood that they are going to fight back. We know the to fight back. We know the targets that we\u2019re going after, targets that we\u2019re going after, right? We don\u2019t do dragnets. We right? We don\u2019t do dragnets. We don\u2019t go door to door. That\u2019s don\u2019t go door to door. That\u2019s never something that ISIS has never something that ISIS has done. But the difference from done. But the difference from previous administrations, his previous administrations, his team can also make what\u2019s called team can also make what\u2019s called collateral arrests. Undocumented collateral arrests. Undocumented immigrants they come across with immigrants they come across with no criminal charges. We\u2019re still no criminal charges. We\u2019re still targeting that worst of the targeting that worst of the worst person you know. Except worst person you know. Except now if we come across someone now if we come across someone who\u2019s standing next to him, who\u2019s standing next to him, who\u2019s also here illegally, we\u2019re who\u2019s also here illegally, we\u2019re going to take that person, too. going to take that person, too. That happened after agents That happened after agents waited for more than two hours waited for more than two hours near the home of a man from El near the home of a man from El Salvador. Ice says he\u2019s been Salvador. Ice says he\u2019s been convicted of DUI and negligent convicted of DUI and negligent manslaughter. The stakeout is manslaughter. The stakeout is something that could not have something that could not have been done last year, due to a been done last year, due to a 2011 policy that limited them, 2011 policy that limited them, targeting people near sensitive targeting people near sensitive locations such as schools or locations such as schools or churches. But that policy was churches. But that policy was rescinded in January by DHS. rescinded in January by DHS. This building behind us is a This building behind us is a Baptist church. You know, Baptist church. You know, despite us not doing anything at despite us not doing anything at the church like we wouldn\u2019t even the church like we wouldn\u2019t even be allowed to be parked in a be allowed to be parked in a parking lot, really, anywhere parking lot, really, anywhere within like a two block radius within like a two block radius of here.

So he\u2019s been removed from the United States removed from the United States previously. Look, my family, my previously. Look, my family, my kids. Understand? You got to go. kids. Understand? You got to go. This is a total change and an This is a total change and an escalation in how immigrants are escalation in how immigrants are being treated. Attorney Michael being treated. Attorney Michael Lukens is with Amica Center for Lukens is with Amica Center for Immigrant Rights. It works to Immigrant Rights. It works to help detainees know their help detainees know their rights. I think what really rights. I think what really concerns me is you don\u2019t look at concerns me is you don\u2019t look at someone who was born in the someone who was born in the United States who had a criminal United States who had a criminal background and say, well, they background and say, well, they are a criminal forever, right? are a criminal forever, right? You don\u2019t label them a criminal You don\u2019t label them a criminal and make them a second class and make them a second class citizen. Why is it okay to do citizen. Why is it okay to do that for an immigrant? Tensions that for an immigrant? Tensions are definitely much, much higher are definitely much, much higher among Frimpong with the among Frimpong with the immigrant advocacy group Casa immigrant advocacy group Casa says. There\u2019s a lot of fear says. There\u2019s a lot of fear right now, especially for right now, especially for families who might lose a parent families who might lose a parent or breadwinner to deportation. I or breadwinner to deportation. I see, you know, moms, right, who see, you know, moms, right, who are trying to console their are trying to console their kids, right? And, you know, kids, right? And, you know, trying to tell them that trying to tell them that everything will be okay when everything will be okay when truly they don\u2019t know whether truly they don\u2019t know whether everything will go okay. Why are everything will go okay. Why are people willing to risk mass people willing to risk mass deportation risk being put in deportation risk being put in detention centers, risk having detention centers, risk having their families separated? Why? their families separated? Why? Because for a lot of people, Because for a lot of people, this is the better life. I think this is the better life. I think the real danger here is that the real danger here is that immigration advocacy groups are immigration advocacy groups are telling people, don\u2019t cooperate, telling people, don\u2019t cooperate, don\u2019t come to the door, don\u2019t don\u2019t come to the door, don\u2019t don\u2019t stop your vehicle. You don\u2019t stop your vehicle. You know, all of these things that know, all of these things that could then lead to criminal could then lead to criminal prosecutions. But people do have prosecutions. But people do have the right to remain silent. They the right to remain silent. They do have the right not to open do have the right not to open their door. If there isn\u2019t a their door. If there isn\u2019t a warrant signed by a judge. warrant signed by a judge. Correct? Correct. And now the Correct? Correct.

A lot hangs in the balance here hangs in the balance here students, teachers, school staff students, teachers, school staff and the federal workers who and the federal workers who support them. Larry Wexler, a support them. Larry Wexler, a former government worker, is former government worker, is enjoying a hard earned enjoying a hard earned retirement. But if you ask him retirement. But if you ask him about what he used to do. I had about what he used to do. I had the greatest job in the world. the greatest job in the world. He worked at the U.S. Department He worked at the U.S. Department of Education, overseeing grants of Education, overseeing grants for special education teachers, for special education teachers, for them to do good things for for them to do good things for children with disabilities and children with disabilities and their families. What could be their families. What could be more fun? After more than three more fun? After more than three decades at the department, Larry decades at the department, Larry left last year, but he still left last year, but he still feels deeply tied to its feels deeply tied to its mission, which is why he\u2019s so mission, which is why he\u2019s so concerned about what\u2019s happening concerned about what\u2019s happening now. I\u2019d like it to be closed now. I\u2019d like it to be closed immediately. President Trump, immediately. President Trump, and led by Elon Musk, have and led by Elon Musk, have already taken action to gut the already taken action to gut the agency. They\u2019ve eliminated at agency. They\u2019ve eliminated at least 70 workers and placed 75 least 70 workers and placed 75 more on leave, according to more on leave, according to union reps. Among the cuts union reps. Among the cuts contracts to help accelerate contracts to help accelerate math learning, improve outcomes math learning, improve outcomes for English learners, and track for English learners, and track student performance. Could it be student performance. Could it be perhaps more efficient? There\u2019s perhaps more efficient? There\u2019s room for efficiencies. I mean, room for efficiencies. I mean, I\u2019m not delusional, but once you I\u2019m not delusional, but once you destroy it, rebuilding it will destroy it, rebuilding it will take decades. The conversation take decades. The conversation about abolishing the Department about abolishing the Department of Ed has existed for decades, of Ed has existed for decades, too. Abolishing the Department too. Abolishing the Department would not abolish the funding would not abolish the funding streams. Congress has to do streams. Congress has to do that. Directs education policy that. Directs education policy studies at the nonpartisan think studies at the nonpartisan think tank American Enterprise tank American Enterprise Institute. The logic behind kind Institute. The logic behind kind of the federal oversight is, of the federal oversight is, well, if we have more people well, if we have more people writing more rules, obviously writing more rules, obviously things have got to get better. I things have got to get better. I would just suggest that\u2019s not would just suggest that\u2019s not necessarily the case. A necessarily the case. A self-described conservative, he self-described conservative, he supports the shakeup but admits supports the shakeup but admits it\u2019s not perfect. I think it\u2019s not perfect. I think they\u2019re moving even more they\u2019re moving even more aggressively than some of us had aggressively than some of us had expected. I think there\u2019s a lot expected. I think there\u2019s a lot of furniture getting broken. A of furniture getting broken. A few pieces of mom\u2019s China along few pieces of mom\u2019s China along the way, but I\u2019m pretty happy the way, but I\u2019m pretty happy with it. What I want to do is with it. What I want to do is let the states run schools. let the states run schools. President Trump has said President Trump has said repeatedly that he\u2019d like to see repeatedly that he\u2019d like to see education controlled by the education controlled by the states, but individual states states, but individual states already control roughly 90% of already control roughly 90% of their education budget and set their education budget and set their school system\u2019s their school system\u2019s educational priorities. Only educational priorities. Only about 10% comes from the about 10% comes from the Department of Education, with Department of Education, with its $79 billion budget for its $79 billion budget for discretionary programs, the discretionary programs, the department helps fund the title department helps fund the title one program to supplement the one program to supplement the needs of low income students and needs of low income students and ensure supports for students ensure supports for students with special needs. Nobody is with special needs. Nobody is suggesting those programs get suggesting those programs get cut, but some are suggesting cut, but some are suggesting moving them to other agencies. A moving them to other agencies. A lot of the president\u2019s actions lot of the president\u2019s actions so far have mirrored a plan laid so far have mirrored a plan laid out in the conservative project out in the conservative project 2025, which proposes sending 2025, which proposes sending special education funding to special education funding to health and Human Services. It\u2019s health and Human Services. It\u2019s statistical collection to the statistical collection to the Department of Commerce\u2019s Census Department of Commerce\u2019s Census Bureau and its Office of Civil Bureau and its Office of Civil Rights to the Department of Rights to the Department of Justice. If you atomize the Justice. If you atomize the department, if you take it apart department, if you take it apart and one piece goes here, one and one piece goes here, one piece goes there, one piece goes piece goes there, one piece goes someplace else, then you don\u2019t someplace else, then you don\u2019t have a collection of people who have a collection of people who are all working together on are all working together on education. Kathryn Lehman education. Kathryn Lehman oversaw civil rights at the oversaw civil rights at the Department of Ed under Obama and Department of Ed under Obama and Biden\u2019s administrations. While Biden\u2019s administrations. While there, she received both praise there, she received both praise and criticism, especially on the and criticism, especially on the right, for her handling of how right, for her handling of how campuses investigated sex campuses investigated sex assault. We\u2019ve seen tremendous assault. We\u2019ve seen tremendous polarization in the country polarization in the country about the various issues that about the various issues that come to the office for Civil come to the office for Civil Rights, but that was just part Rights, but that was just part of her office\u2019s work. Her team of her office\u2019s work. Her team of 600 investigated complaints of 600 investigated complaints of civil and disability rights of civil and disability rights violations in K through 12 violations in K through 12 schools across the country in schools across the country in her last fiscal year.

The News 4 I-Team found that right News 4 I-Team found that right now, nearly 1000 of those cases now, nearly 1000 of those cases remain open in DC, Maryland and remain open in DC, Maryland and Virginia. She\u2019s worried that if Virginia. She\u2019s worried that if civil rights investigations are civil rights investigations are moved to the Department of moved to the Department of Justice, it will pick and choose Justice, it will pick and choose which complaints to pursue. which complaints to pursue. Instead of investigating each Instead of investigating each one. Every single one of the one. Every single one of the cases that comes into the office cases that comes into the office represents a family\u2019s deepest represents a family\u2019s deepest hurts for the past 70 years, hurts for the past 70 years, every Republican president has every Republican president has fought to increase educational fought to increase educational opportunity. Former Education opportunity. Former Education Secretary Arne Duncan told the Secretary Arne Duncan told the I-Team what he\u2019s seeing now is a I-Team what he\u2019s seeing now is a departure from past Republican departure from past Republican administrations. There\u2019s nothing administrations. There\u2019s nothing left or right or R&D about left or right or R&D about helping our babies get off to a helping our babies get off to a good start in life, or teaching good start in life, or teaching kids how to read. These are kids how to read. These are nation building goals. It\u2019s in nation building goals. It\u2019s in our nation\u2019s interest, and every our nation\u2019s interest, and every president has seen that. Trump president has seen that. Trump is the absolute anomaly. Wexler is the absolute anomaly. Wexler worked for former President worked for former President George W Bush when he enacted No George W Bush when he enacted No Child Left Behind, a landmark Child Left Behind, a landmark law that required schools to law that required schools to account for students with account for students with disabilities in their disabilities in their assessments. But he\u2019s worried assessments. But he\u2019s worried too many kids may be left too many kids may be left behind. Now, depending on what behind. Now, depending on what becomes of the department. Am I becomes of the department. Am I passionate about them? Yes. Do I passionate about them? Yes. Do I feel terrible about what they feel terrible about what they could be facing? Really could be facing? Really terrible. We asked the terrible. We asked the Department of Education what Department of Education what will happen to the pending will happen to the pending disability, race and sex disability, race and sex discrimination investigations in discrimination investigations in our area. They have not our area. They have not responded yet. Meanwhile, their responded yet. Meanwhile, their office for Civil Rights under office for Civil Rights under Trump has announced it\u2019s Trump has announced it\u2019s investigating several Northern investigating several Northern Virginia schools on whether Virginia schools on whether their transgender policies their transgender policies discriminated against other discriminated against other students. So, Tracee, what is students. So, Tracee, what is the president\u2019s power when it the president\u2019s power when it comes to making these huge comes to making these huge changes at the department? Well, changes at the department? Well, he would need to get he would need to get congressional approval to do a congressional approval to do a lot of the abolishing of the lot of the abolishing of the Department of Education, and he Department of Education, and he would need Congress to move some would need Congress to move some of its core functions to other of its core functions to other government agencies. And it does government agencies. And it does not appear that he has the votes not appear that he has the votes to make that happen. That being to make that happen. That being said, we have seen President said, we have seen President Trump legislate by executive Trump legislate by executive order. If he tried to do that order. If he tried to do that here, experts tell us it will here, experts tell us it will most likely end up in court. most likely end up in court.
