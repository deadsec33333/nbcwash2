Brandon Aiyuk and Deebo Samuel Brandon Aiyuk and Deebo Samuel played together for the San played together for the San Francisco 49ers. Brandon Aiyuk Francisco 49ers. Brandon Aiyuk very publicly made clear how very publicly made clear how close he and Jayden Daniels close he and Jayden Daniels were. If you go back to last were.

That\u2019s got to be one of impress. That\u2019s got to be one of the big reasons Deebo is so the big reasons Deebo is so excited. It also doesn\u2019t hurt excited. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that Washington decided to go that Washington decided to go ahead and guarantee about $17 ahead and guarantee about $17 million in salary for this million in salary for this season. That would make anybody season. That would make anybody happy too. Now let\u2019s talk about happy too. Now let\u2019s talk about another free agent Washington another free agent Washington brought back. This would be brought back. This would be defensive lineman Clelin defensive lineman Clelin Ferrell. Now, what they\u2019re Ferrell. Now, what they\u2019re saying is Ferrell talking about saying is Ferrell talking about what Washington\u2019s defense can be what Washington\u2019s defense can be now that they\u2019re getting guys now that they\u2019re getting guys back and bringing some new guys back and bringing some new guys in. It\u2019s just it\u2019s just suggest in. It\u2019s just it\u2019s just suggest that we\u2019re not complacent. You that we\u2019re not complacent. You know we always trying to find know we always trying to find ways to get better. And ways to get better. And regardless of whatever happened regardless of whatever happened last year, it\u2019s in the past. And last year, it\u2019s in the past. And you got to you got to reload. you got to you got to reload. You got to reload the clip and You got to reload the clip and try to get better and have a try to get better and have a chance to come out, because chance to come out, because everybody\u2019s getting better right everybody\u2019s getting better right now. So that\u2019s what I see, and now. So that\u2019s what I see, and I\u2019m excited about all the new I\u2019m excited about all the new guys we have in the room. We all guys we have in the room. We all just want to come in and just want to come in and compete, try to earn, earn, earn compete, try to earn, earn, earn everything that\u2019s given to us. everything that\u2019s given to us. So I\u2019m excited. I mean, one of So I\u2019m excited. I mean, one of the biggest things, you know, the biggest things, you know, outside of, you know, just the outside of, you know, just the different physical things that different physical things that we do is that you can ask a lot we do is that you can ask a lot more out of the room that we more out of the room that we have now, because if you, you have now, because if you, you know, if you look at the D line know, if you look at the D line or just the guys that we signed, or just the guys that we signed, a lot of veterans, you know, a a lot of veterans, you know, a lot of a lot of guys that have lot of a lot of guys that have played a lot of ball. And played a lot of ball. And obviously we\u2019re a very multiple obviously we\u2019re a very multiple team. So just the aspect of team. So just the aspect of being able to do a lot of being able to do a lot of different things and you can put different things and you can put a lot of things on us and then a lot of things on us and then not seem as overwhelming. You not seem as overwhelming. You know, just with the veteran know, just with the veteran players that we have and that we players that we have and that we did sign, I think that\u2019s going did sign, I think that\u2019s going to be the biggest thing. Just to be the biggest thing. Just the just the aspect that we the just the aspect that we always, you know, there\u2019s always, you know, there\u2019s nothing that they feel like they nothing that they feel like they can\u2019t ask us to do. Really can\u2019t ask us to do. Really interesting comments there from interesting comments there from Ferrell. Of course, he was in Ferrell. Of course, he was in Washington last year when that D Washington last year when that D line had some good moments, but line had some good moments, but certainly took some bumps and certainly took some bumps and bruises too. Now it\u2019s easy and bruises too. Now it\u2019s easy and probably overly simplistic if probably overly simplistic if you want to say Will Ferrell you want to say Will Ferrell saying Jon Allen\u2019s gone and the saying Jon Allen\u2019s gone and the guys coming in are veterans and guys coming in are veterans and that they\u2019re more versatile, I that they\u2019re more versatile, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case at don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case at all. I don\u2019t think this has all. I don\u2019t think this has anything to do with Allen\u2019s anything to do with Allen\u2019s departure. I think they\u2019re just departure. I think they\u2019re just bringing in some guys with bringing in some guys with different body types. Javon different body types. Javon Kinlaw is really tall, and he\u2019s Kinlaw is really tall, and he\u2019s a different kind of player than a different kind of player than Washington has had. And then Washington has had. And then think about a guy like Dietrich think about a guy like Dietrich Wise who\u2019s a real run stopper on Wise who\u2019s a real run stopper on the edge. Think about Eddie the edge. Think about Eddie Goldman, a guy that goes 330. Goldman, a guy that goes 330. They haven\u2019t had that body type They haven\u2019t had that body type on this D line, probably since on this D line, probably since Pot roast or Chris Baker or Pot roast or Chris Baker or something. So they\u2019re bringing something. So they\u2019re bringing in different pieces that will in different pieces that will give the defense more give the defense more versatility. I don\u2019t think versatility. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an accident. Another that\u2019s an accident. Another thing that was not an accident. thing that was not an accident. Washington resigned the people\u2019s Washington resigned the people\u2019s punter tress way. Tress way. And punter tress way. Tress way.

Just to put that out there. There\u2019s a lot of change there. There\u2019s a lot of change here in Philly. And that is here in Philly. And that is because the Eagles went into because the Eagles went into this offseason knowing they this offseason knowing they wanted to keep all of their top wanted to keep all of their top players. They have a lot of players. They have a lot of players making a lot of money. players making a lot of money. And to do that and to continue And to do that and to continue to extend them like Lane Johnson to extend them like Lane Johnson and Saquon Barkley gave them and Saquon Barkley gave them raises. They needed to let some raises. They needed to let some of the players go. That really of the players go. That really developed here and got big money developed here and got big money in free agency, and now they in free agency, and now they need younger players to step up. need younger players to step up. So they\u2019ve lost about seven So they\u2019ve lost about seven players on defense. Some key players on defense. Some key players, especially on the players, especially on the defensive line and at the defensive line and at the secondary positions. But they secondary positions. But they believe they have some young believe they have some young players that will start to play players that will start to play better given an opportunity. And better given an opportunity. And they signed some free agents, they signed some free agents, bargain free agents like Azeez bargain free agents like Azeez Ojulari of the Giants and Josh Ojulari of the Giants and Josh Uche, who had over 11 sacks two Uche, who had over 11 sacks two years ago with the Patriots. years ago with the Patriots. They\u2019re hoping that they can They\u2019re hoping that they can compete with some of the younger compete with some of the younger guys on the defensive line and guys on the defensive line and you still have Nolan Smith and you still have Nolan Smith and then in the secondary, of then in the secondary, of course, they signed Adoree course, they signed Adoree Jackson from the Giants bargain Jackson from the Giants bargain deals in free agency.

And he is going to become one of the highest to become one of the highest paid defensive players in the paid defensive players in the next two years. So a lot of next two years. So a lot of change in Philly. That\u2019s what change in Philly. That\u2019s what happens when you win the Super happens when you win the Super Bowl. But the Eagles hope they Bowl. But the Eagles hope they can continue to draft well and can continue to draft well and keep building their team that keep building their team that way and stay in contention.

OSA Odighizuwa, who is a resign. OSA Odighizuwa, who is a defensive tackle, because in the defensive tackle, because in the new system that Matt Eberflus, new system that Matt Eberflus, the new defensive coordinator the new defensive coordinator who was fired by the bears, is who was fired by the bears, is going to run the three technique going to run the three technique at the defensive tackle position at the defensive tackle position is important. So they took care is important. So they took care of that, but they didn\u2019t do of that, but they didn\u2019t do anything else. They asked Dak anything else.

The offense Stadium was empty. The offense was anemic. Daniel Jones, once was anemic. Daniel Jones, once viewed as the franchise viewed as the franchise quarterback, was released in quarterback, was released in midseason, and I haven\u2019t even midseason, and I haven\u2019t even gotten to the Giants worst gotten to the Giants worst nightmare. Saquon Barkley nightmare. Saquon Barkley signing with the Eagles and signing with the Eagles and turning in one of the best turning in one of the best seasons by a running back in NFL seasons by a running back in NFL history.

One of the weak the secondary. One of the weak spots on a barren roster. spots on a barren roster.

A year ago, walk in free agency. A year ago, all he did was play at an all all he did was play at an all pro level. Malik Nabers was a pro level. Malik Nabers was a revelation as a rookie. He was revelation as a rookie. He was really good. But who is getting really good. But who is getting him the football? Any excitement him the football? Any excitement following the Jameis Winston following the Jameis Winston signing was immediately tempered signing was immediately tempered by the decision to sign Russell by the decision to sign Russell Wilson, who\u2019s now in his third Wilson, who\u2019s now in his third team in three years. The Giants team in three years. The Giants hold the third pick in next hold the third pick in next month\u2019s draft and could still month\u2019s draft and could still select Cam Ward or Shedeur select Cam Ward or Shedeur Sanders. But is that really the Sanders. But is that really the best use of a premium pick when best use of a premium pick when you have so many holes on the you have so many holes on the roster? Only time will tell. But roster? Only time will tell. But another season like the last two another season like the last two and owner John Mara will and owner John Mara will certainly see more planes flying certainly see more planes flying over MetLife Stadium and over MetLife Stadium and dumpster fire might be the dumpster fire might be the nicest thing those banners have nicest thing those banners have to say. JP, back to you, Bruce. to say. JP, back to you, Bruce. Thank you very much. It\u2019s Thank you very much. It\u2019s remarkable what\u2019s happening with remarkable what\u2019s happening with the Giants. That\u2019s one of the the Giants. That\u2019s one of the most stable, well-run most stable, well-run organizations in the NFL. The organizations in the NFL. The Mara family\u2019s been in charge up Mara family\u2019s been in charge up there for probably close to 100 there for probably close to 100 years, for maybe more than 100 years, for maybe more than 100 years now, and yet they just years now, and yet they just can\u2019t get it right. And what I can\u2019t get it right. And what I say this all the time on my say this all the time on my radio show is that the NFL is radio show is that the NFL is about self-preservation. And about self-preservation. And right now you\u2019ve got a GM and right now you\u2019ve got a GM and Joe Shane and a head coach in Joe Shane and a head coach in Brian Daboll for them to bring Brian Daboll for them to bring in Jameis Winston and Russell in Jameis Winston and Russell Wilson in the same week, does Wilson in the same week, does that make any sense other than that make any sense other than they\u2019re trying to save their they\u2019re trying to save their job? And if those guys get seven job? And if those guys get seven wins out of that group, does wins out of that group, does that really help the Giants long that really help the Giants long term, especially when there\u2019s a term, especially when there\u2019s a manning possibly in next year\u2019s manning possibly in next year\u2019s draft?

Let\u2019s get it going here. My guy Ben Purcell asks the My guy Ben Purcell asks the first question is the running first question is the running back position a priority for back position a priority for Washington heading into the Washington heading into the draft? Great question Ben. I draft? Great question Ben. I don\u2019t know specifically. I think don\u2019t know specifically. I think Washington\u2019s front office, Adam Washington\u2019s front office, Adam Peters, they really subscribe to Peters, they really subscribe to a best player available theory a best player available theory that they want to take the best that they want to take the best guy that\u2019s there. And when you guy that\u2019s there. And when you draft at 29 and you really don\u2019t draft at 29 and you really don\u2019t have that many picks after all have that many picks after all these trades, we\u2019ll see what the these trades, we\u2019ll see what the priorities are. Certainly I priorities are. Certainly I think edge rusher maybe corner think edge rusher maybe corner got to be near the top. But got to be near the top. But running back is really deep in running back is really deep in this draft and they\u2019ve basically this draft and they\u2019ve basically brought back their entire brought back their entire running back room. I mean even running back room. I mean even Chris Rodriguez, Jerry Jeremy Chris Rodriguez, Jerry Jeremy McNichols those guys have been McNichols those guys have been resigned. But what Dan Quinn resigned. But what Dan Quinn always preaches competition. always preaches competition. That just because somebody That just because somebody resigned in March does not resigned in March does not guarantee them a roster spot in guarantee them a roster spot in September? Certainly I could see September? Certainly I could see a running back\u2019s name getting a running back\u2019s name getting called by the Burgundy and gold called by the Burgundy and gold in late April. Go number two. in late April. Go number two. What do we got? Ooh, the What do we got? Ooh, the suspense is killing me. Elliott suspense is killing me. Elliott or Elliott, I don\u2019t know, King or Elliott, I don\u2019t know, King Bo, 26, says. Do you believe Bo, 26, says. Do you believe that Washington Commanders that Washington Commanders should put Gallup at the two? should put Gallup at the two? No, no, no, this is nuts. You No, no, no, this is nuts. You put Gallup at the two and Debo put Gallup at the two and Debo in the slot are at running back in the slot are at running back due to Gallup is a better route due to Gallup is a better route runner. Listen, listen, let\u2019s runner. Listen, listen, let\u2019s all relax about Michael Gallup. all relax about Michael Gallup. Let\u2019s all relax about Michael Let\u2019s all relax about Michael Gallup. He\u2019s had some good Gallup. He\u2019s had some good seasons. Undeniably. He\u2019s shown seasons. Undeniably. He\u2019s shown some real vertical speed. But some real vertical speed. But it\u2019s been a few years, man. It\u2019s it\u2019s been a few years, man. It\u2019s been a few years. Remember that been a few years. Remember that the Commanders right now can the Commanders right now can have a 90 man roster. And have a 90 man roster. And Michael Gallup, while they\u2019re Michael Gallup, while they\u2019re excited to have him here and he excited to have him here and he chose to come to Washington, chose to come to Washington, that doesn\u2019t even guarantee him that doesn\u2019t even guarantee him a roster spot. When you\u2019re a roster spot. When you\u2019re talking about the number two talking about the number two wide receiver they drafted Luke wide receiver they drafted Luke McCaffrey last year. This is a McCaffrey last year. This is a draft and develop coaching draft and develop coaching staff. You\u2019ve got to hope Luke staff. You\u2019ve got to hope Luke McCaffrey is able to take a big McCaffrey is able to take a big step for this offense. I won\u2019t step for this offense. I won\u2019t be shocked if they draft another be shocked if they draft another wide receiver. Plus they brought wide receiver. Plus they brought back Noah Brown. Noah Brown was back Noah Brown. Noah Brown was the number two last year on a the number two last year on a highly functional offense. I highly functional offense. I think if anything you\u2019re talking think if anything you\u2019re talking about Terry Noah Brown, Debo so about Terry Noah Brown, Debo so chill with Michael Gallup. It\u2019s chill with Michael Gallup. It\u2019s terrific he\u2019s here. If he still terrific he\u2019s here. If he still has the vertical speed, that\u2019s a has the vertical speed, that\u2019s a great thing to have. But let\u2019s great thing to have. But let\u2019s all just relax a little. Daily all just relax a little. Daily income marketing I\u2019ll take some income marketing I\u2019ll take some of that. Do you think the of that. Do you think the offensive staff already has offensive staff already has communicated to Brandon Coleman communicated to Brandon Coleman whether he will play right whether he will play right tackle or at one of the guard tackle or at one of the guard spots, as he could be working on spots, as he could be working on different footwork techniques? different footwork techniques? Now? I imagine they called Now? I imagine they called Coleman when they traded for Coleman when they traded for Tunsil. I imagine that very Tunsil. I imagine that very much. But keep in mind, Coleman much. But keep in mind, Coleman played all over the place in played all over the place in college at TCU. I don\u2019t think college at TCU. I don\u2019t think the footwork stuff is going to the footwork stuff is going to be that much of an issue. But be that much of an issue. But keep in mind to right tackle. keep in mind to right tackle. Andrew Wiley reworked his deal. Andrew Wiley reworked his deal. Sam Cosmi, the right guard who Sam Cosmi, the right guard who plays kind of at that Pro Bowl plays kind of at that Pro Bowl level. He injured that knee in level. He injured that knee in the NFC title game. So Cosmi is the NFC title game. So Cosmi is likely going to start the season likely going to start the season on the PUP list. It seems likely on the PUP list. It seems likely that Sam Cosmi misses at least that Sam Cosmi misses at least the first month of the season. the first month of the season. Sam Cosmi injured his knee in Sam Cosmi injured his knee in late September. I mean, the I\u2019m late September. I mean, the I\u2019m sorry in late January just sorry in late January just project nine months, which is a project nine months, which is a pretty fast recovery from an ACL pretty fast recovery from an ACL and that gets you to October. So and that gets you to October. So I think they\u2019ll have more than I think they\u2019ll have more than enough spots at least to start enough spots at least to start things up. What are we going? things up. What are we going? One more here. Paul\u2019s banister. One more here. Paul\u2019s banister. I like the picture of the dog. I like the picture of the dog. Paul. Would it surprise anyone Paul. Would it surprise anyone if at the draft, the Commanders if at the draft, the Commanders went for a 75% to 25% split? went for a 75% to 25% split? That\u2019s a lot of math for me in That\u2019s a lot of math for me in favor of defensive players. favor of defensive players. First two players taken CB and D First two players taken CB and D line, maybe I think they\u2019re line, maybe I think they\u2019re going to go best player going to go best player available. Go back. Last year, available. Go back. Last year, nobody on earth thought they nobody on earth thought they were going d line at the top of were going d line at the top of the second round. Everybody the second round. Everybody thought there would be a tackle, thought there would be a tackle, right? Only it wasn\u2019t because right? Only it wasn\u2019t because Johnny Newton fell to them and Johnny Newton fell to them and they really wanted Newton. They they really wanted Newton. They thought he gave them a great thought he gave them a great opportunity. So if somebody opportunity. So if somebody falls to them at wideout, falls to them at wideout, running back, whatever it is, I running back, whatever it is, I think they\u2019re going to make that think they\u2019re going to make that move because they believe in move because they believe in their draft board. That\u2019s what their draft board. That\u2019s what good organizations do, even if good organizations do, even if it\u2019s a position where you might it\u2019s a position where you might not need to load it up. Frankly, people I have the opportunity to serve. That\u2019s what working for serve. That\u2019s what working for you is. We\u2019re back on all ears. you is. We\u2019re back on all ears. And as always, it\u2019s time to find And as always, it\u2019s time to find something to bet on. You think something to bet on. You think it\u2019s March? There\u2019s nothing to it\u2019s March? There\u2019s nothing to bet on. Wrong. Here we go. My bet on. Wrong. Here we go. My guy Bakari has found something guy Bakari has found something wacky. Washington Commanders to wacky. Washington Commanders to score one plus rushing TD in score one plus rushing TD in every regular season game this every regular season game this fall, plus 2200. So obviously fall, plus 2200. So obviously that\u2019s a long shot. That\u2019s Vegas that\u2019s a long shot. That\u2019s Vegas telling you it\u2019s unlikely. Why? telling you it\u2019s unlikely. Why? I kind of like it. Jayden I kind of like it. Jayden Daniels is going to be a heavy Daniels is going to be a heavy part in the rush game. So you\u2019re part in the rush game. So you\u2019re not just betting on running not just betting on running backs like for some teams, backs like for some teams, you\u2019re just betting on running you\u2019re just betting on running backs to score in every game. backs to score in every game. But you\u2019ve got Jayden Daniels But you\u2019ve got Jayden Daniels who\u2019s going to get touchdowns on who\u2019s going to get touchdowns on the ground. Oh by the way they the ground.

We\u2019re going all in on the Washington Commanders, and Washington Commanders, and everybody knows it was just a everybody knows it was just a few weeks ago that Washington few weeks ago that Washington decided to trade with San decided to trade with San Francisco for Deebo Samuel. Francisco for Deebo Samuel. Deebo instantly gives this Deebo instantly gives this offense a new weapon, a offense a new weapon, a different type of player, not different type of player, not necessarily a receiver, not necessarily a receiver, not necessarily a running back, but necessarily a running back, but an athlete, a chess piece, a an athlete, a chess piece, a Swiss Army knife. Now Washington Swiss Army knife. Now Washington got Deebo for a song. It only got Deebo for a song. It only cost him a fifth round pick. For cost him a fifth round pick. For a guy that has an all pro season a guy that has an all pro season on his resume, and is only two on his resume, and is only two years removed from almost a 1200 years removed from almost a 1200 yard season. But the big yard season. But the big question with Deebo was, are question with Deebo was, are they going to rework that deal? they going to rework that deal? Well, on Wednesday we got an Well, on Wednesday we got an answer. Adam Schefter reported answer. Adam Schefter reported that Washington and Deebo Samuel that Washington and Deebo Samuel reworked their deal to give him reworked their deal to give him $17 million guaranteed for the $17 million guaranteed for the 2025 season, and they added 2025 season, and they added another $3 million worth of another $3 million worth of incentives. It\u2019s my sense from incentives. It\u2019s my sense from talking to folks in Ashburn, talking to folks in Ashburn, this is about Dan Quinn, Adam this is about Dan Quinn, Adam Peters, Kliff Kingsbury telling Peters, Kliff Kingsbury telling Deebo, listen, we want you here. Deebo, listen, we want you here. And you know what I\u2019m hearing? And you know what I\u2019m hearing? The other players want Deebo The other players want Deebo here too. Here\u2019s Noah Brown on here too. Here\u2019s Noah Brown on Washington\u2019s new wideout. Deebo Washington\u2019s new wideout. Deebo is a great player. He\u2019s been a is a great player. He\u2019s been a great player in this league for great player in this league for a while. Very versatile. Brings a while. Very versatile. Brings a lot of toughness to our room, a lot of toughness to our room, a lot of physicality that I that a lot of physicality that I that I know will all benefit from. So I know will all benefit from. So I\u2019m excited to get out there and I\u2019m excited to get out there and work with him. You know it\u2019s work with him. You know it\u2019s just versatility. He can line up just versatility. He can line up in the backfield. He can play up in the backfield. He can play up the slot, he can play outside the slot, he can play outside and he\u2019s a real problem when he and he\u2019s a real problem when he gets the ball in his hands. So I gets the ball in his hands. So I think that is something that think that is something that defenses are going to be on high defenses are going to be on high alert for. And you know with the alert for. And you know with the quarterback we have Terry our quarterback we have Terry our other running backs. It just it other running backs. It just it puts a lot on defensive plates. puts a lot on defensive plates. And I think that you know we And I think that you know we will all benefit from it will all benefit from it including Deebo Noah Brown also including Deebo Noah Brown also signed back with Washington. signed back with Washington. He\u2019ll be on the team again this He\u2019ll be on the team again this fall was obviously a really fall was obviously a really important piece. Everybody important piece. Everybody remembers the Hail Mary, but he remembers the Hail Mary, but he was proving himself as a really was proving himself as a really good wide receiver prior to that good wide receiver prior to that internal organ injury late in internal organ injury late in the season. Back to Deebo. You the season. Back to Deebo. You can have some angst about them can have some angst about them guaranteeing this money if you guaranteeing this money if you want, but odds are they probably want, but odds are they probably had conversations about this way had conversations about this way back when they traded for him. back when they traded for him. And I think for Deebo, it shows And I think for Deebo, it shows a commitment to the team. If a commitment to the team. If Deebo delivers, he will be Deebo delivers, he will be underpaid. That\u2019s clear. If underpaid. That\u2019s clear. If Deebo delivers about what he did Deebo delivers about what he did last season in San Francisco, last season in San Francisco, 800 yards or so, he\u2019ll probably 800 yards or so, he\u2019ll probably be about properly paid. Remember be about properly paid. Remember Dyami Brown got $10 million in Dyami Brown got $10 million in free agency last week. Prices free agency last week. Prices for everything are going up now. for everything are going up now. Deebo Samuel wasn\u2019t the only big Deebo Samuel wasn\u2019t the only big trade that Washington made. trade that Washington made. Obviously the biggest one. The Obviously the biggest one.

That is a big time advantage for a guy like advantage for a guy like Kingsbury that likes to come up Kingsbury that likes to come up with schematic advantages all with schematic advantages all over the field. Oh, and by the over the field. Oh, and by the way, you introduced Deebo Samuel way, you introduced Deebo Samuel into that mix. That offense into that mix. That offense could be significantly better. could be significantly better. Now defensively, there\u2019s been Now defensively, there\u2019s been some questions. Has Washington some questions. Has Washington gotten that much better? One big gotten that much better? One big signing was Javon Kinlaw. Now signing was Javon Kinlaw. Now Kinlaw was in San Francisco when Kinlaw was in San Francisco when Adam Peters was last year was Adam Peters was last year was with the Jets. But for Kinlaw with the Jets. But for Kinlaw now he\u2019s coming home. Well, I now he\u2019s coming home. Well, I grew up in northeast D.C, so I\u2019m grew up in northeast D.C, so I\u2019m a real skin fan. Point blank a real skin fan. Point blank period. And I was just telling period. And I was just telling somebody when I was growing up, somebody when I was growing up, Trent Williams was on the team Trent Williams was on the team and Jordan Reed, and then I got and Jordan Reed, and then I got to be teammates with them guys to be teammates with them guys my rookie year. For me to be my rookie year. For me to be able to be on this team now is a able to be on this team now is a full circle moment for me, and I full circle moment for me, and I know a lot about the know a lot about the transformation, man, it was in transformation, man, it was in the blink of an eye. It\u2019s like the blink of an eye. It\u2019s like you go from zero to hero, you you go from zero to hero, you know what I mean? And that\u2019s know what I mean? And that\u2019s what all that\u2019s all I\u2019m about. what all that\u2019s all I\u2019m about. You know, that\u2019s kind of my You know, that\u2019s kind of my life. And I can\u2019t wait to thrive life. And I can\u2019t wait to thrive with these guys. Man, I feel so with these guys. Man, I feel so blessed and I\u2019m so happy to be blessed and I\u2019m so happy to be here. So my whole family here. here. So my whole family here. So I love those stories. And So I love those stories. And just think about this from an on just think about this from an on field perspective. Adam Peters field perspective. Adam Peters knows Kinlaw Darryl Tapp, knows Kinlaw Darryl Tapp, Washington\u2019s defensive line Washington\u2019s defensive line coach. He knows Kinlaw. They coach. He knows Kinlaw. They sought him out and brought him sought him out and brought him here on the first day of free here on the first day of free agency. Clearly, they think he agency. Clearly, they think he can really add an element to can really add an element to this defensive line. We haven\u2019t this defensive line. We haven\u2019t seen it yet. That doesn\u2019t mean seen it yet. That doesn\u2019t mean that the team hasn\u2019t seen it that the team hasn\u2019t seen it yet. Now let\u2019s get into yet. Now let\u2019s get into something else here. I want to something else here. I want to get back to what they\u2019re saying get back to what they\u2019re saying because Marcus Mariota resigned because Marcus Mariota resigned with Washington. I think this is with Washington. I think this is a huge deal to keep the a huge deal to keep the continuity in that quarterback continuity in that quarterback room. But it also means a lot to room. But it also means a lot to Mariota and Jayden. Well I think Mariota and Jayden. Well I think it was always the right fit. I it was always the right fit. I think for me it was more of an think for me it was more of an ego and pride thing of seeing ego and pride thing of seeing what was out there and seeing if what was out there and seeing if I could maybe get another shot I could maybe get another shot at it. I will never close that at it. I will never close that door if that opportunity door if that opportunity presents itself as a competitor, presents itself as a competitor, I got to take it. But like I was I got to take it. But like I was saying earlier, there had to be saying earlier, there had to be something that was just very something that was just very like unbelievable that you like unbelievable that you couldn\u2019t pass up. That would couldn\u2019t pass up. That would have made me leave. And at the have made me leave. And at the end of the day, after everything end of the day, after everything and having all these and having all these discussions, this was the right discussions, this was the right fit. And I\u2019m very, very excited fit. And I\u2019m very, very excited to be back. When you have a room to be back. When you have a room that\u2019s predicated on making sure that\u2019s predicated on making sure that the guy that\u2019s playing is that the guy that\u2019s playing is ready to roll and you give him ready to roll and you give him everything that he needs and everything that he needs and that room is intact, I think that room is intact, I think that\u2019s huge. So the more that we that\u2019s huge. So the more that we can get Jay continuing to play, can get Jay continuing to play, how he\u2019s been playing, how he\u2019s been playing, continuing to give him that continuing to give him that confidence, I think really it confidence, I think really it breeds life not only into our breeds life not only into our room but into our entire into room but into our entire into the entire team. So I\u2019m I\u2019m so the entire team. So I\u2019m I\u2019m so excited to be back. Like I said, excited to be back. Like I said, it\u2019s just it was such a fun team it\u2019s just it was such a fun team and fun environment to be in and fun environment to be in that I\u2019m just I\u2019m I\u2019m really that I\u2019m just I\u2019m I\u2019m really looking forward to April and looking forward to April and getting things going again. What getting things going again. What maturity from Mariota I mean maturity from Mariota I mean what an incredible attitude. And what an incredible attitude. And I love that he\u2019s honest. These I love that he\u2019s honest. These are elite athletes that all want are elite athletes that all want to play. And of course Mariota to play. And of course Mariota is going to at least look around is going to at least look around and see what\u2019s out there. But as and see what\u2019s out there. But as soon as he realized that kind of soon as he realized that kind of that that magical spot wasn\u2019t that that magical spot wasn\u2019t there. I want to be in there. I want to be in Washington. I want to be with Washington. I want to be with Jayden Daniels. You saw the shot Jayden Daniels. You saw the shot of Mariota helping Jayden of Mariota helping Jayden Daniels there towards the end of Daniels there towards the end of the Atlanta game, as Jayden was the Atlanta game, as Jayden was just gassed. That game went to just gassed. That game went to overtime if I remember overtime if I remember correctly. And Mariota correctly. And Mariota throughout the season was a throughout the season was a leader and a friend to Jayden leader and a friend to Jayden Daniels. And by the way when he Daniels. And by the way when he was on the field he was was on the field he was excellent. Think about the week excellent. Think about the week 18 game at Dallas where he 18 game at Dallas where he engineered that comeback and the engineered that comeback and the touchdown throw to Terry touchdown throw to Terry McLaurin at the end. That\u2019s a McLaurin at the end. That\u2019s a dude you want back in your dude you want back in your quarterback room. That\u2019s a win quarterback room. That\u2019s a win for all parties involved. Now for all parties involved. Now speaking of all parties involved speaking of all parties involved in the running back room, Jeremy in the running back room, Jeremy McNichols carved out an McNichols carved out an important role for Washington important role for Washington last season. He\u2019s also back with last season. He\u2019s also back with the Burgundy and Gold. Remember, the Burgundy and Gold. Remember, McNichols had four touchdowns McNichols had four touchdowns last year. But he says last year. But he says expectations are only going up. expectations are only going up. I think it brings a lot of I think it brings a lot of confidence. You know, we have confidence. You know, we have something to build upon. We something to build upon. We built a started to build a solid built a started to build a solid foundation last year. And I foundation last year. And I think with the guys coming in, think with the guys coming in, the expectations that you had the expectations that you had when you come to the Commanders when you come to the Commanders now and the expectations that we now and the expectations that we have when we go play on on have when we go play on on Sunday, but nobody holds a Sunday, but nobody holds a higher expectations than we hold higher expectations than we hold in this building. So I just in this building. So I just think just having something to think just having something to build on and knowing the build on and knowing the playbook and knowing, you know, playbook and knowing, you know, just having familiar faces just having familiar faces around throughout the building around throughout the building is a is a great advantage for is a is a great advantage for us. It really could be. If you us. It really could be. If you think about offensively, they think about offensively, they had to start at square one last had to start at square one last year. New quarterback, new year. New quarterback, new coaches, new everything. coaches, new everything. Nothing\u2019s really new anymore. Nothing\u2019s really new anymore. Obviously you\u2019re going to add Obviously you\u2019re going to add some new pieces. Deebo Samuel, some new pieces. Deebo Samuel, Laremy Tunsil, whatever might Laremy Tunsil, whatever might happen in the draft. But happen in the draft. But everybody has an understanding everybody has an understanding of what the standard is in that of what the standard is in that building and how they operate, building and how they operate, and maybe they\u2019ll be able to do and maybe they\u2019ll be able to do that much better. Now we have a that much better. Now we have a very special version of what you very special version of what you missed. We already talked about missed. We already talked about Javon Kinlaw coming back to DC. Javon Kinlaw coming back to DC. Does anybody remember Eddie Does anybody remember Eddie Goldman was an absolute high Goldman was an absolute high school star in Washington at school star in Washington at Friendship Collegiate Academy, Friendship Collegiate Academy, was a draft pick by the Chicago was a draft pick by the Chicago Bears in 2015 after he played Bears in 2015 after he played his college ball at Florida his college ball at Florida State, was a second round pick State, was a second round pick by the bears. There\u2019s some by the bears. There\u2019s some highlights from back in the high highlights from back in the high school days, and you got to hear school days, and you got to hear Eddie talking going way back now Eddie talking going way back now to 2011 about what his future to 2011 about what his future was going to be like when he was going to be like when he left DC. Yeah, okay. I\u2019m like, left DC. Yeah, okay. I\u2019m like, I\u2019m the man in high school. But I\u2019m the man in high school. But when I go to college, it\u2019s like when I go to college, it\u2019s like I\u2019m at the bottom of the depth I\u2019m at the bottom of the depth chart, you know? So I mean, I chart, you know? So I mean, I really haven\u2019t done anything really haven\u2019t done anything yet. So like, I\u2019m not big headed yet. So like, I\u2019m not big headed because I know when I get to because I know when I get to college, I mean, it\u2019s all going college, I mean, it\u2019s all going to, you know, go away. The to, you know, go away. The process was it was real easy, process was it was real easy, man. They reached out and it was man. They reached out and it was kind of a no brainer. You know. kind of a no brainer. You know. You know it was home team, my You know it was home team, my favorite team as a child you favorite team as a child you know. And it\u2019s a great team. So know. And it\u2019s a great team. So it was a no brainer. The it was a no brainer. The drought. Wait wait wait what do drought. Wait wait wait what do you mean by that. You know we you mean by that. You know we you know, historically, you you know, historically, you know, when I was like, you know, know, when I was like, you know, elementary, middle school, we elementary, middle school, we wasn\u2019t like a winning team like wasn\u2019t like a winning team like that, you know? So it was a lot that, you know? So it was a lot of hardships, you know, what a of hardships, you know, what a cool story. Another guy coming cool story. Another guy coming back to DC, back to his hometown back to DC, back to his hometown with a chance to be part of a with a chance to be part of a winning organization. When winning organization. When Goldman talks about the drought, Goldman talks about the drought, he ain\u2019t lying. He was born in he ain\u2019t lying. He was born in 94. He was born after all the 94. He was born after all the Super Bowls, the Joe Gibbs, John Super Bowls, the Joe Gibbs, John Riggins, Darrell Green. He Riggins, Darrell Green. He doesn\u2019t remember any of that. doesn\u2019t remember any of that. And there\u2019s so many young people And there\u2019s so many young people in our area that are in the same in our area that are in the same boat. So let\u2019s hope Jayden boat. So let\u2019s hope Jayden Daniels, this new operation Daniels, this new operation they\u2019ve got over in Ashburn are they\u2019ve got over in Ashburn are going to create new memories. going to create new memories. Last year. They certainly did Last year. They certainly did time to build on it. Now when we time to build on it. Now when we come back, March is all about serve. That\u2019s what working for you is. This is All Ears with JP you is. This is All Ears with JP Finlay. We are back on all ears Finlay. We are back on all ears now when you get to this time of now when you get to this time of year. March. Everybody wants to year. March. Everybody wants to talk about the madness. So we talk about the madness. So we tried to come up with our own tried to come up with our own version of it. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re version of it. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. We\u2019re starting with going to do. We\u2019re starting with the coming in bracket. These are the coming in bracket. These are players that are arriving in players that are arriving in Washington. One seed Laremy Washington. One seed Laremy Tunsil, four seed Will Harris Tunsil, four seed Will Harris could be a really important could be a really important piece in the secondary. piece in the secondary. Obviously we\u2019ve talked plenty Obviously we\u2019ve talked plenty about Deebo Samuel and then about Deebo Samuel and then you\u2019ve got Javon Kinlaw. Now you\u2019ve got Javon Kinlaw. Now who\u2019s the most important of this who\u2019s the most important of this group. I think this bracket is group. I think this bracket is going to be pretty chalky. It\u2019s going to be pretty chalky. It\u2019s obviously going to be you got obviously going to be you got Tunsil and you got Deebo. Both Tunsil and you got Deebo. Both of these guys are huge additions of these guys are huge additions to this offense. Tunsil at left to this offense. Tunsil at left tackle. You can argue that\u2019s a tackle. You can argue that\u2019s a more important position, but if more important position, but if Deebo is right, he\u2019s one of the Deebo is right, he\u2019s one of the most explosive players in the most explosive players in the NFL. So this is a really tight NFL. So this is a really tight contest. They had to make trades contest. They had to make trades for both of these guys. But if for both of these guys. But if you got to pick a winner. We\u2019ll you got to pick a winner. We\u2019ll come back to that because it\u2019s come back to that because it\u2019s the coming back bracket. Now the coming back bracket. Now look we got Bobby Wagner as your look we got Bobby Wagner as your one seed tress way the people\u2019s one seed tress way the people\u2019s punter he\u2019s on here. He\u2019s a fan punter he\u2019s on here. He\u2019s a fan favorite and he\u2019s really good at favorite and he\u2019s really good at what he does Zach Ertz was huge what he does Zach Ertz was huge for this offense. And then for this offense. And then Marcus Mariota you heard me talk Marcus Mariota you heard me talk about his importance to the about his importance to the continuity of that quarterback continuity of that quarterback room. How that helps Jayden room. How that helps Jayden Daniels and how well he played. Daniels and how well he played. But for me this one\u2019s not that But for me this one\u2019s not that difficult. If you\u2019re talking difficult. If you\u2019re talking about the most important guys about the most important guys here it\u2019s Wagner and it\u2019s Ertz. here it\u2019s Wagner and it\u2019s Ertz. These guys were leaders of the These guys were leaders of the offense and the defense offense and the defense specifically. I think you had to specifically. I think you had to bring both of these fellas back. bring both of these fellas back. I think there\u2019s a reason they I think there\u2019s a reason they got those deals done before free got those deals done before free agency opened. It\u2019s because agency opened. It\u2019s because Washington didn\u2019t even want to Washington didn\u2019t even want to risk losing those guys. So what risk losing those guys. So what have we got left. The Final have we got left. The Final four. That\u2019s where I hope four. That\u2019s where I hope Maryland goes. That\u2019s where Maryland goes. That\u2019s where everybody wants to see what everybody wants to see what happens. Right. So in the new happens. Right. So in the new guy bracket, Tunsil versus Debo guy bracket, Tunsil versus Debo I really, really like Debo. I really, really like Debo. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think he Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think he could be wildly explosive for could be wildly explosive for Washington. All the stuff at the Washington. All the stuff at the line of scrimmage that Kliff line of scrimmage that Kliff Kingsbury likes to do, those Kingsbury likes to do, those little shallow crossers. Last little shallow crossers. Last year you had Dyami Brown, year you had Dyami Brown, Olamide, Zacchaeus running Olamide, Zacchaeus running those. Both of those guys are those. Both of those guys are elsewhere now, but now you got elsewhere now, but now you got an athlete like Debo running an athlete like Debo running those. I think Debo is poised to those. I think Debo is poised to have a monster year in have a monster year in Washington. I think that\u2019s why Washington. I think that\u2019s why they guaranteed some of the they guaranteed some of the money. But let\u2019s be real, left money. But let\u2019s be real, left tackle blocking for Jayden tackle blocking for Jayden cementing you know, offensive cementing you know, offensive line. That was pretty good line. That was pretty good especially when healthy last especially when healthy last year. But that offensive line year. But that offensive line gets to take a monster step up. gets to take a monster step up. And then on the bottom half of And then on the bottom half of this the guys that stuck around this the guys that stuck around give me Bobby Wagner I\u2019m give me Bobby Wagner I\u2019m switching sides I need Camara to switching sides I need Camara to give me lessons on this thing. give me lessons on this thing. But if you think about Wagner, But if you think about Wagner, the defense if you don\u2019t bring the defense if you don\u2019t bring him back, he\u2019s an all pro him back, he\u2019s an all pro linebacker. We know this offense linebacker. We know this offense can cook. We saw them do it even can cook. We saw them do it even without a stud left tackle last without a stud left tackle last season Bobby Wagner. If you season Bobby Wagner. If you don\u2019t have Bobby Wagner what don\u2019t have Bobby Wagner what exactly does that defense look exactly does that defense look like. Because there haven\u2019t been like. Because there haven\u2019t been massive upgrades via free massive upgrades via free agency. There haven\u2019t really agency. There haven\u2019t really been the trades on the defensive been the trades on the defensive side of the ball. Wagner to me side of the ball. Wagner to me might be the most important might be the most important person that Washington has person that Washington has signed or resigned in this signed or resigned in this offseason. That might seem offseason. That might seem crazy. Tunsil is a huge crazy. Tunsil is a huge addition. Debo is a huge addition. Debo is a huge addition, but the offense was addition, but the offense was good already. Defensively, they good already. Defensively, they were decent. They were good were decent. They were good enough. But if you take Wagner enough. But if you take Wagner off that group, I\u2019m not sure off that group, I\u2019m not sure what you got. He was an all pro. what you got. He was an all pro. He was a captain for you. Wagner He was a captain for you. Wagner was huge. And all of these was huge. And all of these signings, everybody that made signings, everybody that made our big board and our brackets our big board and our brackets important to Washington. But I important to Washington. But I think Wagner takes the crown in think Wagner takes the crown in the All Ears bracket. Now, when the opportunity to serve. That\u2019s what working for you is. This is what working for you is. This is All Ears with JP Finlay. Welcome All Ears with JP Finlay. Welcome back. It\u2019s all yours. And it\u2019s back. It\u2019s all yours. And it\u2019s your turn. Every week we take a your turn. Every week we take a bunch of questions via social bunch of questions via social media, usually Twitter or X or media, usually Twitter or X or whatever you want to call it, whatever you want to call it, but I don\u2019t know, you can hit me but I don\u2019t know, you can hit me up from wherever. Jummy Olabanji up from wherever. Jummy Olabanji said she was going to email me. said she was going to email me. I\u2019m waiting Jummy you email me, I\u2019m waiting Jummy you email me, you will get on all ears. That you will get on all ears. That is a promise. Let\u2019s get to this is a promise. Let\u2019s get to this week\u2019s batch of questions. We week\u2019s batch of questions. We usually get lots of them. Let\u2019s usually get lots of them. Let\u2019s start by man. KB, DMV versus KB start by man. KB, DMV versus KB says last year was a says last year was a recalibration and they willed recalibration and they willed themselves to an NFC title game. themselves to an NFC title game. What should fans expect this What should fans expect this season? What should the front season? What should the front office and players expect as office and players expect as well? Here\u2019s what I know about well? Here\u2019s what I know about Dan Quinn the way he runs his Dan Quinn the way he runs his program and Adam Peters too. program and Adam Peters too. It\u2019s all about competition and It\u2019s all about competition and steady improvement. So you want steady improvement. So you want to see competition and steady to see competition and steady improvement. Now, that doesn\u2019t improvement. Now, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the only way to necessarily mean the only way to improve from an NFC title game improve from an NFC title game would be to go to a Super Bowl. would be to go to a Super Bowl. I don\u2019t think you can put those I don\u2019t think you can put those types of expectations on types of expectations on something when every year, every something when every year, every season in the NFL, every game in season in the NFL, every game in the NFL is kind of its own the NFL is kind of its own living, breathing organism. living, breathing organism. Every season is a is a really Every season is a is a really finite resource. So every year finite resource. So every year is different. If it wasn\u2019t, is different. If it wasn\u2019t, people would make money hand people would make money hand over fist betting in the NFL. over fist betting in the NFL. They don\u2019t because every week They don\u2019t because every week you never know what to expect. you never know what to expect. You need health first and You need health first and foremost. And you just you can\u2019t foremost. And you just you can\u2019t guarantee that in a really guarantee that in a really physical league. For me, I think physical league. For me, I think fair expectations with what fair expectations with what they\u2019ve established, especially they\u2019ve established, especially what they can do offensively and what they can do offensively and just how special of a player just how special of a player Jayden Daniels is, they\u2019ve Jayden Daniels is, they\u2019ve entered that category for me, entered that category for me, where the divisional round of where the divisional round of the playoffs should at least be the playoffs should at least be part of the conversation. When part of the conversation. When you have a top eight you have a top eight quarterback, a top five quarterback, a top five quarterback, you\u2019re always quarterback, you\u2019re always thinking about January football. thinking about January football. That should be the driver. That should be the driver. Whether that means you win the Whether that means you win the NFC East or your wild card team, NFC East or your wild card team, you get in and you got to win you get in and you got to win some games like they did this some games like they did this year. I think you\u2019re talking year. I think you\u2019re talking about the second round of the about the second round of the playoffs. That, at least to me, playoffs. That, at least to me, is the expectation. Let\u2019s keep is the expectation. Let\u2019s keep these moving. Question number these moving. Question number two. How often do you think two. How often do you think Deebo will be lined up in the Deebo will be lined up in the backfield? Great question. This backfield? Great question. This is from Tanner Kirkpatrick. is from Tanner Kirkpatrick. Tanner appreciate you watching Tanner appreciate you watching and hanging out via social I and hanging out via social I don\u2019t know I don\u2019t know the don\u2019t know I don\u2019t know the frequency. I think the better frequency. I think the better numbers to look at would be numbers to look at would be debo\u2019s usage in San Francisco debo\u2019s usage in San Francisco before Christian McCaffrey before Christian McCaffrey showed up, because obviously showed up, because obviously once they traded for McCaffrey, once they traded for McCaffrey, Debo\u2019s role changed a little bit Debo\u2019s role changed a little bit because McCaffrey became your because McCaffrey became your workhorse. Before McCaffrey, workhorse. Before McCaffrey, they didn\u2019t have an exact they didn\u2019t have an exact workhorse or probably more workhorse or probably more carries for Deebo in the carries for Deebo in the backfield. I think Washington backfield. I think Washington would. B-Rob Ekeler. They would. B-Rob Ekeler. They brought their whole running back brought their whole running back room back. They\u2019re not desperate room back. They\u2019re not desperate to get Deebo carries. But I to get Deebo carries. But I think they want to get him think they want to get him touches I think they want to get touches I think they want to get him involved early. I certainly him involved early. I certainly think he\u2019s going to be a part of think he\u2019s going to be a part of the backfield rotation. He could the backfield rotation. He could also line up in the backfield also line up in the backfield and still go out for passes. It and still go out for passes. It doesn\u2019t necessarily necessarily doesn\u2019t necessarily necessarily mean he\u2019s going to be getting mean he\u2019s going to be getting carries, but he\u2019s going to be carries, but he\u2019s going to be all over the field. Kliff all over the field. Kliff Kingsbury is an innovator and Kingsbury is an innovator and he\u2019ll be innovative with Debo, he\u2019ll be innovative with Debo, Jason R says, who\u2019s someone who Jason R says, who\u2019s someone who was on the roster that will have was on the roster that will have a larger role this year than a larger role this year than they did last year. For me, you they did last year. For me, you got to think, rookies, I think got to think, rookies, I think Johnny Newton. I think the Johnny Newton. I think the development of Johnny Newton, development of Johnny Newton, frankly, was a big reason why frankly, was a big reason why Washington decided, hey John Washington decided, hey John Allen, we love you. You\u2019ve been Allen, we love you. You\u2019ve been great for the organization, but great for the organization, but we\u2019re going to let you walk. I we\u2019re going to let you walk. I think they see a lot in Newton. think they see a lot in Newton. And I would look at Luke And I would look at Luke McCaffrey. I would look at Ben McCaffrey. I would look at Ben Senate. Those are guys that Senate. Those are guys that played last season. But the played last season. But the offensive production wasn\u2019t offensive production wasn\u2019t really there. I think this is really there. I think this is supposed to be a draft and supposed to be a draft and develop program. The coaches develop program. The coaches want to develop players. Adam want to develop players. Adam Peters wants to build through Peters wants to build through the draft. You need your guys the draft. You need your guys from last year to step up a from last year to step up a level this coming season. All level this coming season. All right. Let\u2019s get to another right. Let\u2019s get to another question here. Who do we got? question here. Who do we got? Where are we going? I never know Where are we going? I never know when it\u2019s going to be silly or when it\u2019s going to be silly or serious. Jimmy Alderson I hope I serious. Jimmy Alderson I hope I got that right. Says how has got that right. Says how has your job changed good and bad, your job changed good and bad, since the team is back doing since the team is back doing well again? Broad question how well again? Broad question how is my job changed? Honestly, is my job changed? Honestly, last year was probably the most last year was probably the most fun I had professionally. I mean fun I had professionally. I mean to cover. I had never covered a to cover. I had never covered a winning playoff game for the winning playoff game for the Burgundy and gold I\u2019d cover. I Burgundy and gold I\u2019d cover. I had covered other playoff games, had covered other playoff games, I had covered Super Bowls for I had covered Super Bowls for NBC and lots of things, but NBC and lots of things, but never for the Burgundy and gold. never for the Burgundy and gold. So that was a career highlight. So that was a career highlight. Winning locker rooms are way Winning locker rooms are way more fun than losing locker more fun than losing locker rooms, but you still have a job rooms, but you still have a job to do. I still have to approach to do. I still have to approach it professionally. The only it professionally. The only thing that\u2019s gotten different, I thing that\u2019s gotten different, I would say, is and some of it would say, is and some of it might be, you know, increased might be, you know, increased role here at NBC, but the amount role here at NBC, but the amount of people that stop and want to of people that stop and want to talk to me about what Washington talk to me about what Washington is doing has increased is doing has increased tremendously. And the type of tremendously. And the type of people, it\u2019s everybody under the people, it\u2019s everybody under the sun. They love talking to me at sun. They love talking to me at giant, especially when I have my giant, especially when I have my kids. It\u2019s a blast. We got one kids. It\u2019s a blast. We got one thing left. I think we got the serve. That\u2019s what working for you is. This is All Ears with JP you is. This is All Ears with JP Finlay. Oh, hey. Sorry I wasn\u2019t Finlay. Oh, hey. Sorry I wasn\u2019t working on my bracket. I would working on my bracket. I would never be working on my bracket never be working on my bracket while we\u2019re doing all ears. while we\u2019re doing all ears. Ever, ever, ever. I would never Ever, ever, ever. I would never be doing that. Let\u2019s get to the be doing that. Let\u2019s get to the weekend line. Let\u2019s focus weekend line. Let\u2019s focus everybody. Weekend line time. everybody. Weekend line time. This is the time of year for This is the time of year for degenerate betting. And boy oh degenerate betting. And boy oh boy. If you\u2019re looking for NFL boy. If you\u2019re looking for NFL bets in March, we got something bets in March, we got something for you. 2025 NFL Draft. Who\u2019s for you. 2025 NFL Draft. Who\u2019s Washington going to take first? Washington going to take first? Now keep in mind this language Now keep in mind this language is fairly vague. They\u2019re not is fairly vague. They\u2019re not saying first round pick or the saying first round pick or the 29th overall pick which they 29th overall pick which they currently hold because there currently hold because there could always be trades. So keep could always be trades. So keep in mind why some of the numbers in mind why some of the numbers might look a little different might look a little different than you\u2019d expect. These are than you\u2019d expect. These are odds offered by DraftKings, but odds offered by DraftKings, but they\u2019re saying for Washington\u2019s they\u2019re saying for Washington\u2019s first player drafted to be a first player drafted to be a d-lineman or an edge rusher is d-lineman or an edge rusher is plus 200. Now, overwhelmingly, plus 200. Now, overwhelmingly, if you were to ask someone, what if you were to ask someone, what does Washington need to do in does Washington need to do in the draft is take a D lineman, the draft is take a D lineman, specifically an edge rusher. But specifically an edge rusher. But you get those juicier odds you get those juicier odds because at 29, where because at 29, where Washington\u2019s currently slated to Washington\u2019s currently slated to pick, who knows who\u2019s going to pick, who knows who\u2019s going to be there? Seriously. I mean, be there? Seriously. I mean, this is a team that has shown this is a team that has shown they go with best player they go with best player available no matter what. available no matter what. They\u2019re going to stick to their They\u2019re going to stick to their draft board. The only position I draft board. The only position I know they won\u2019t take first is know they won\u2019t take first is quarterback. That\u2019s the only one quarterback. That\u2019s the only one you can actually rule out. But you can actually rule out. But if a stud receiver is there a if a stud receiver is there a stud corner, a stud safety, a stud corner, a stud safety, a stud lineman, they may just feel stud lineman, they may just feel they have to go that direction. they have to go that direction. Remember last year they took Remember last year they took Johnny Newton at the top of the Johnny Newton at the top of the second round? That wasn\u2019t the second round? That wasn\u2019t the plan. They just thought they plan. They just thought they were getting first round value were getting first round value at the top of the second round. at the top of the second round. So that\u2019s why that D-lineman So that\u2019s why that D-lineman edge rusher is plus 200. Sure edge rusher is plus 200. Sure seems like they\u2019re going to go seems like they\u2019re going to go that way. But nobody knows for that way. But nobody knows for sure when they\u2019re going to sure when they\u2019re going to draft. Even they could trade out draft. Even they could trade out of 29. What if they trade out of of 29. What if they trade out of 29 to recoup some of the draft 29 to recoup some of the draft picks from the Tunsil trade and picks from the Tunsil trade and even the Tebow trade? Well, then even the Tebow trade? Well, then their first pick might be coming their first pick might be coming at 62. Maybe they trade out of at 62. Maybe they trade out of that one. Their first pick could that one. Their first pick could be 80 for all we know, and be 80 for all we know, and there\u2019s just no way to know there\u2019s just no way to know exactly. That\u2019s why you get the exactly. That\u2019s why you get the juicy odds. Here\u2019s a little juicy odds. Here\u2019s a little update for us. We\u2019ll get to hear update for us. We\u2019ll get to hear from Dan Quinn in not too many from Dan Quinn in not too many weeks. Owners meetings are weeks. Owners meetings are coming up. We will be there. coming up. We will be there.

But we just have a lot of free agents and we have a lot of free agents and we still have a lot of holes to still have a lot of holes to fill on the roster we have. I fill on the roster we have. I think the second least amount of think the second least amount of players on our roster in the players on our roster in the league right now, so we\u2019ll be league right now, so we\u2019ll be busy, but we want to spend, you busy, but we want to spend, you know, on Commanders and spend know, on Commanders and spend the right way. So that\u2019s that\u2019s the right way. So that\u2019s that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to look at it. how we\u2019re going to look at it. How important is it to get a few How important is it to get a few of those deals done before free of those deals done before free agency opens? Some of the guys agency opens? Some of the guys you\u2019ve identified as Commanders you\u2019ve identified as Commanders keep them in house. Yeah, keep them in house. Yeah, certainly you like to do that. certainly you like to do that. And we\u2019re we\u2019re talking with a And we\u2019re we\u2019re talking with a lot of those guys right now. It lot of those guys right now. It just depends on what they want just depends on what they want to do. And if they want to, if to do. And if they want to, if we can come to an agreement we can come to an agreement before free agency, some guys before free agency, some guys want to hit free agency and see want to hit free agency and see what their market is. Some guys what their market is. Some guys want to get stuff done right want to get stuff done right away. The great thing is that away. The great thing is that the culture that DQ created, the culture that DQ created, there\u2019s a lot of guys that want there\u2019s a lot of guys that want to come back, and we\u2019ve had a to come back, and we\u2019ve had a lot of really good conversations lot of really good conversations with that, and so proud of that, with that, and so proud of that, proud of what DQ has created and proud of what DQ has created and having a lot of guys that want having a lot of guys that want to be Commanders going forward. to be Commanders going forward. Tell us which ones want to come Tell us which ones want to come back? No. It\u2019d be great if we back? No. It\u2019d be great if we knew. Unfortunately we don\u2019t. knew. Unfortunately we don\u2019t. You saw the highlights there. You saw the highlights there. Washington has a number of major Washington has a number of major contributors facing free agency contributors facing free agency Jeremy Chinn, Zach Ertz among Jeremy Chinn, Zach Ertz among them. We\u2019ll talk about Bobby them. We\u2019ll talk about Bobby Wagner a little later. Another Wagner a little later. Another guy. But here\u2019s the thing guy. But here\u2019s the thing Washington has so many decisions Washington has so many decisions to make, Adam Peters explained. to make, Adam Peters explained. They like to talk about their They like to talk about their total cash spend instead of just total cash spend instead of just salary cap space. What that salary cap space. What that means is think about how they means is think about how they game up these contracts in pro game up these contracts in pro football. Now, if a player gets football. Now, if a player gets a signing bonus, he generally a signing bonus, he generally gets that money right away. Or gets that money right away. Or perhaps it\u2019s divided up into a perhaps it\u2019s divided up into a couple of lump sum payments. But couple of lump sum payments. But for the salary cap, they\u2019re able for the salary cap, they\u2019re able to divide up that signing bonus to divide up that signing bonus over the years of the contract. over the years of the contract. Well, if you\u2019re actually cutting Well, if you\u2019re actually cutting the check, if you\u2019re Josh Harris the check, if you\u2019re Josh Harris and Mitch Rales, you want to and Mitch Rales, you want to know how much cash you\u2019re know how much cash you\u2019re spending. And that\u2019s what Peters spending. And that\u2019s what Peters was kind of explaining there in was kind of explaining there in the different way that they look the different way that they look at contracts. Here\u2019s another way at contracts. Here\u2019s another way to look at contracts. Jon Allen to look at contracts. Jon Allen is undoubtedly a very good is undoubtedly a very good player for Washington, has been player for Washington, has been for some time. He\u2019s been here for some time. He\u2019s been here long enough. He played for all long enough. He played for all three versions of the team name. three versions of the team name. Well, it sure looks like Jon Well, it sure looks like Jon Allen isn\u2019t going to be here for Allen isn\u2019t going to be here for the 2025 season with Jon. He\u2019s the 2025 season with Jon. He\u2019s another person who\u2019s who\u2019s been another person who\u2019s who\u2019s been a great commander, a great, you a great commander, a great, you know, person for this franchise. know, person for this franchise. And he\u2019s going into the last And he\u2019s going into the last year of his deal and wanted to year of his deal and wanted to give him and his representation. give him and his representation. Blake Baratz, who\u2019s a really Blake Baratz, who\u2019s a really good agent. They just talked good agent. They just talked about it and said wanted to be about it and said wanted to be able to explore opportunities. able to explore opportunities. And so we let them do that and And so we let them do that and we\u2019re staying in contact with we\u2019re staying in contact with them, you know, every day just them, you know, every day just texting with them this morning. texting with them this morning. And, you know, really everything And, you know, really everything is still on the table in terms is still on the table in terms of whether it\u2019s a trade or of whether it\u2019s a trade or staying here or, or whatever. So staying here or, or whatever. So we\u2019re still going through that. we\u2019re still going through that. It\u2019s kind of early in the It\u2019s kind of early in the stages. We haven\u2019t done a lot of stages. We haven\u2019t done a lot of exploring yet, but that\u2019s kind exploring yet, but that\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re at right now. of where we\u2019re at right now. When you\u2019ve got a guy like Jon When you\u2019ve got a guy like Jon Allen and the business of Allen and the business of football is the business of football is the business of football. How are those football. How are those conversations for you as someone conversations for you as someone that really cares about his that really cares about his players? Yeah, and I think what players? Yeah, and I think what I\u2019d like to make sure I\u2019m clear, I\u2019d like to make sure I\u2019m clear, they established it. And so I they established it. And so I get to be a part of it, but it\u2019s get to be a part of it, but it\u2019s theirs. This time of year theirs. This time of year specifically, is when football specifically, is when football and business intersect, and and business intersect, and that\u2019s part of it. It\u2019s part of that\u2019s part of it. It\u2019s part of it for all of us. And so it\u2019s it for all of us. And so it\u2019s not uncomfortable because you not uncomfortable because you want to make sure if you do have want to make sure if you do have relationships, you want to relationships, you want to communicate with people. communicate with people. Players, coaches, all of those Players, coaches, all of those things. But it is this things. But it is this postseason time that those take postseason time that those take place. No team is the same year place. No team is the same year to year. We know that. And so to year. We know that. And so those are always, you know, those are always, you know, decisions regarding team. And decisions regarding team. And you know, how do you do it the you know, how do you do it the best to get the whole thing best to get the whole thing together. And it\u2019s a puzzle and together. And it\u2019s a puzzle and it\u2019s never one thing and how it it\u2019s never one thing and how it goes. And I\u2019m certainly goes. And I\u2019m certainly fortunate with Adam. Like we fortunate with Adam. Like we just talk about the team every just talk about the team every day and how we can do things to day and how we can do things to get better. And so that\u2019s not get better. And so that\u2019s not specific to one player. That\u2019s specific to one player. That\u2019s specific to the whole thing. specific to the whole thing. That was very not specific to That was very not specific to one player. Coach asked about one player. Coach asked about Jon. And I got an answer about Jon. And I got an answer about everybody. Here\u2019s the reality of everybody. Here\u2019s the reality of Jon Allen. If you\u2019re a Jon Allen. If you\u2019re a Commanders fan, if you\u2019re a Commanders fan, if you\u2019re a Burgundy and gold fan, you Burgundy and gold fan, you should really applaud and should really applaud and appreciate all the effort Allen appreciate all the effort Allen put in over the years. But the put in over the years. But the reality of the business of reality of the business of football, I like that line from football, I like that line from DQ when he said, this is the DQ when he said, this is the intersection of football and intersection of football and business. Jon Allen missed a lot business. Jon Allen missed a lot of time last year with that pec of time last year with that pec injury. There\u2019s no guaranteed injury. There\u2019s no guaranteed money left on his deal. He money left on his deal. He probably wants guaranteed money, probably wants guaranteed money, and if that means he gets a new and if that means he gets a new 2 or 3 year deal, whether it\u2019s 2 or 3 year deal, whether it\u2019s in free agency or in a trade, in free agency or in a trade, that that\u2019s probably the that that\u2019s probably the security he\u2019s looking for. And security he\u2019s looking for. And he deserves to go find that, he deserves to go find that, even if it means leaving even if it means leaving Washington. Now, for the folks Washington. Now, for the folks out there that are really out there that are really excited about a potential Jon excited about a potential Jon Allen trade, and maybe it nets Allen trade, and maybe it nets you Myles Garrett or something you Myles Garrett or something crazy. I wouldn\u2019t be so sure. crazy. I wouldn\u2019t be so sure. After talking to a number of After talking to a number of league sources, I think you\u2019re league sources, I think you\u2019re kind of talking about a pick kind of talking about a pick swap like Jon Allen and a fifth. swap like Jon Allen and a fifth. Maybe you get a fourth back. I Maybe you get a fourth back. I don\u2019t think this is going to net don\u2019t think this is going to net a. Certainly not a Thursday a. Certainly not a Thursday night pick. And I don\u2019t even night pick. And I don\u2019t even think a Friday night pick. I think a Friday night pick. I think you\u2019re talking Saturday think you\u2019re talking Saturday draft picks. Maybe that could be draft picks. Maybe that could be moved for somebody else though. moved for somebody else though. We\u2019ll see. Now there\u2019s another We\u2019ll see. Now there\u2019s another big name player that a lot of big name player that a lot of Washington fans want back in Washington fans want back in Burgundy and gold. That would be Burgundy and gold. That would be Bobby Wagner. And certainly Dan Bobby Wagner. And certainly Dan Quinn had plenty to say about Quinn had plenty to say about the veteran linebacker. Bobby the veteran linebacker. Bobby Wagner is somewhere getting Wagner is somewhere getting better today, and I don\u2019t know better today, and I don\u2019t know where it is or what it looks where it is or what it looks like or how he\u2019s doing it, but like or how he\u2019s doing it, but that\u2019s the type of attitude that that\u2019s the type of attitude that we want to chase. Constant we want to chase. Constant improvement, digging for it improvement, digging for it hard, and if and if he can do hard, and if and if he can do it, then everybody else in the it, then everybody else in the organization kind of follow suit organization kind of follow suit into that space. You brought up into that space. You brought up Bobby Wagner, kind of unprompted Bobby Wagner, kind of unprompted at the podium. What does it mean at the podium. What does it mean knowing you\u2019ve got all these knowing you\u2019ve got all these pending free agents and how big pending free agents and how big of an impact they made, like all of an impact they made, like all of the players, when whenever we of the players, when whenever we bring somebody in, whether it\u2019s bring somebody in, whether it\u2019s a drafted player or a free a drafted player or a free agent, this is the role. This is agent, this is the role. This is what I see him doing. And so what I see him doing. And so sometimes you meet him and other sometimes you meet him and other times you even exceed those what times you even exceed those what they can be. And so many guys they can be. And so many guys play these key roles on our play these key roles on our team. You\u2019ve heard the term glue team. You\u2019ve heard the term glue guys and things that can, you guys and things that can, you know, make an impact to others. know, make an impact to others. And there were so many of them. And there were so many of them. But Bobby was certainly one of But Bobby was certainly one of those as a driving factor in those as a driving factor in that. And so he was a really that. And so he was a really important piece to what we did. important piece to what we did. Now, Dan Quinn said repeatedly Now, Dan Quinn said repeatedly that any questions about Bobby that any questions about Bobby Wagner\u2019s future in Washington or Wagner\u2019s future in Washington or elsewhere would have to be elsewhere would have to be referred to Bobby Wagner\u2019s referred to Bobby Wagner\u2019s agent, Dan Quinn, got a kick out agent, Dan Quinn, got a kick out of saying this, and he said it of saying this, and he said it over and over because Bobby over and over because Bobby Wagner acts as his own agent. Wagner acts as his own agent. Now, you know, to now let\u2019s get Now, you know, to now let\u2019s get into some of the other parts into some of the other parts going on around the NFL. I want going on around the NFL. I want to do specifically what they\u2019re to do specifically what they\u2019re saying because there\u2019s so much saying because there\u2019s so much conversation about Myles conversation about Myles Garrett. Can Washington get Garrett. Can Washington get Myles Garrett, can Philly get Myles Garrett, can Philly get Myles Garrett. Well in Cleveland Myles Garrett. Well in Cleveland they don\u2019t think Myles Garrett they don\u2019t think Myles Garrett is going anywhere. You know is going anywhere. You know understand the frustration. understand the frustration. We\u2019ve had plenty of dialog. But We\u2019ve had plenty of dialog. But ultimately my responsibility is ultimately my responsibility is to make the decisions that are to make the decisions that are best for the best for the best for the best for the Browns. And having Myles apart Browns. And having Myles apart of the organization is a huge of the organization is a huge piece of that. And that\u2019s not piece of that. And that\u2019s not unusual. It\u2019s not the first for unusual. It\u2019s not the first for us. It won\u2019t be the probably us. It won\u2019t be the probably won\u2019t be the last. It\u2019s not the won\u2019t be the last. It\u2019s not the first across the league. But we first across the league. But we respect we appreciate Myles. And respect we appreciate Myles. And you know like I said we\u2019re not you know like I said we\u2019re not we\u2019re not interested in moving we\u2019re not interested in moving him. So they\u2019re not interested him. So they\u2019re not interested in moving him. Well they might in moving him. Well they might not have a choice depending how not have a choice depending how much Garrett wants to cause some much Garrett wants to cause some trouble this offseason, he could trouble this offseason, he could probably force his way out. Both probably force his way out. Both Barry, the general manager, and Barry, the general manager, and Kevin Stefanski, the Browns head Kevin Stefanski, the Browns head coach, said Garrett\u2019s not going coach, said Garrett\u2019s not going anywhere. That\u2019s not part of our anywhere. That\u2019s not part of our plan. Plans change in the NFL. I plan. Plans change in the NFL. I don\u2019t think anything happens don\u2019t think anything happens with Garrett until closer to the with Garrett until closer to the draft. You\u2019d have to work out a draft. You\u2019d have to work out a contract. There\u2019s a whole lot of contract. There\u2019s a whole lot of guaranteed money involved, but guaranteed money involved, but I\u2019m not so convinced. Myles I\u2019m not so convinced. Myles Garrett is definitely staying in Garrett is definitely staying in Cleveland, despite what the Cleveland, despite what the brass there might be saying. brass there might be saying. Now, I do want to make time for Now, I do want to make time for what you missed. This is an what you missed. This is an important one because we important one because we hammered the organization when hammered the organization when they got the bad grades on these they got the bad grades on these NFLPA report cards. Well, you NFLPA report cards. Well, you know what? Now the grades are know what? Now the grades are good. They\u2019ve moved way up. And good. They\u2019ve moved way up. And here\u2019s Dan Quinn talking about here\u2019s Dan Quinn talking about the improvements for Washington. the improvements for Washington. They have gone way up here. And They have gone way up here. And DQ supports ownership support of DQ supports ownership support of his team. I thought the first his team. I thought the first thing I thought of, I was thing I thought of, I was pleased to see treatment of pleased to see treatment of families. And that goes to Josh, families. And that goes to Josh, honestly. And Adam, there\u2019s not honestly. And Adam, there\u2019s not a there\u2019s no gap in between what a there\u2019s no gap in between what he says and what he does. And so he says and what he does. And so to have that type of reflection to have that type of reflection in a year is really big. We told in a year is really big. We told him how important this was to him how important this was to us. He heard that from the us. He heard that from the players and then took action on players and then took action on that. And I think that\u2019s that. And I think that\u2019s honestly like what that honestly like what that relationship has been for us. relationship has been for us. What do you need to win and how What do you need to win and how do we go about and do that? And do we go about and do that? And so to see things like family so to see things like family support and having that support and having that increase, that\u2019s really big. The increase, that\u2019s really big. The families, our families, players, families, our families, players, coaches, the organization, they coaches, the organization, they make a lot of sacrifices for us make a lot of sacrifices for us to do what we can do. And so to to do what we can do. And so to have that right there, team have that right there, team travel, all those to me, just travel, all those to me, just reflect back to Josh and the reflect back to Josh and the vision of what it can be. And I vision of what it can be. And I couldn\u2019t be more proud to be a couldn\u2019t be more proud to be a part of it. You see Josh Harris part of it. You see Josh Harris there with his brother Gabe there with his brother Gabe talking about family being talking about family being important. Josh Harris famously important. Josh Harris famously said, I\u2019m not an f minus guy. We said, I\u2019m not an f minus guy. We will improve this and look will improve this and look across the board. F minus to B+ across the board. F minus to B+ for treatment of families. That for treatment of families. That really drives the bus. Nobody, really drives the bus. Nobody, nobody likes to go to work and nobody likes to go to work and then come home and their wife is then come home and their wife is mad about something. If you mad about something. If you start taking care of the start taking care of the families, that makes everything families, that makes everything go better. Look at Team Travel f go better. Look at Team Travel f two and a look at head coach Dan two and a look at head coach Dan Quinn was voted the best coach Quinn was voted the best coach in this NFLPA poll. This really in this NFLPA poll. This really says a lot about Ownership\u2019s says a lot about Ownership\u2019s commitment to winning. You have commitment to winning. You have an organization that is serious an organization that is serious about chasing a championship. about chasing a championship. Commanders fans that\u2019s got to Commanders fans that\u2019s got to feel good to hear. We got plenty feel good to hear. We got plenty more from Indy when we return. the opportunity to serve. That\u2019s what working for you is. This is what working for you is. This is All Ears with JP Finlay. We are All Ears with JP Finlay. We are back. It\u2019s all ears. Live on back. It\u2019s all ears. Live on location. Indianapolis, Indiana. location. Indianapolis, Indiana. At the NFL Scouting combine. At the NFL Scouting combine. They say next is here. Well, so They say next is here. Well, so are we. So far in the show, are we. So far in the show, you\u2019ve heard from Dan Quinn and you\u2019ve heard from Dan Quinn and Adam Peters, as well as Browns Adam Peters, as well as Browns general manager Andrew Berry. general manager Andrew Berry. Let\u2019s check in with the Let\u2019s check in with the defending Super Bowl champions defending Super Bowl champions Howie Roseman and how the New Howie Roseman and how the New Jersey native GM of the Eagles Jersey native GM of the Eagles that just won a Super Bowl. Oh, that just won a Super Bowl. Oh, by the way, his second. How he by the way, his second. How he likes to build a team. Never likes to build a team. Never feel like we can. We have enough feel like we can. We have enough linemen or linemen always on the linemen or linemen always on the lookout for those positions at lookout for those positions at every level, whether it\u2019s in every level, whether it\u2019s in free agency, whether it\u2019s in the free agency, whether it\u2019s in the draft, whether it\u2019s after the draft, whether it\u2019s after the draft, whether it\u2019s on the draft, whether it\u2019s on the street, it\u2019s really like an street, it\u2019s really like an unhealthy obsession, Zach, to be unhealthy obsession, Zach, to be honest with you. And so I\u2019m honest with you. And so I\u2019m never feel good enough because I never feel good enough because I can convince myself, you know, I can convince myself, you know, I can go back and watch a game can go back and watch a game from this year and see that we from this year and see that we were down three offensive were down three offensive linemen, you know, and then I\u2019m linemen, you know, and then I\u2019m going, well, now we need eight going, well, now we need eight starters, you know. And so it\u2019s starters, you know. And so it\u2019s the same with the D line I think the same with the D line I think that those are incredibly that those are incredibly important positions. And you important positions. And you know you can never have enough know you can never have enough of them. An unhealthy obsession of them. An unhealthy obsession with the offensive and defensive with the offensive and defensive lines. And if you look at how lines. And if you look at how Philly beats teams that\u2019s how Philly beats teams that\u2019s how they do it. They are stronger at they do it. They are stronger at the point of attack, at the line the point of attack, at the line of scrimmage, game after game, of scrimmage, game after game, week after week. And that\u2019s what week after week. And that\u2019s what won them the Super Bowl. Go back won them the Super Bowl. Go back and watch that. Patrick Mahomes and watch that. Patrick Mahomes was under duress the entire was under duress the entire game. Meanwhile, Jalen Hurts had game. Meanwhile, Jalen Hurts had all the time in the world. The all the time in the world. The Philadelphia model is similar to Philadelphia model is similar to what Joe Gibbs model was, going what Joe Gibbs model was, going back to the Washington glory back to the Washington glory days of the 80s and 90s. It\u2019s days of the 80s and 90s. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s unusual to want to not that it\u2019s unusual to want to build from the inside out, it\u2019s build from the inside out, it\u2019s just how good Philly has been at just how good Philly has been at it. And here\u2019s the biggest it. And here\u2019s the biggest problem for Washington. Sure, problem for Washington. Sure, the whole NFL is now chasing the the whole NFL is now chasing the Eagles. They are the Super Bowl Eagles. They are the Super Bowl champions. But Washington\u2019s got champions. But Washington\u2019s got to deal with them in the to deal with them in the division. So what does that mean division. So what does that mean for Dan Quinn as he looks to in for Dan Quinn as he looks to in his second season. Continue to his second season. Continue to build up the Commanders. It\u2019s build up the Commanders. It\u2019s probably bigger than like this probably bigger than like this specific thing. But what at the specific thing. But what at the very front of the line man, are very front of the line man, are we looking for like the we looking for like the competitive spirit in a player competitive spirit in a player and guys who just absolutely and guys who just absolutely love ball? They\u2019re willing to love ball? They\u2019re willing to show that connection to their show that connection to their teammates. And some of that teammates. And some of that shows up in meetings like it shows up in meetings like it does here about leadership, does here about leadership, about tell me some examples. The about tell me some examples. The tape and that part of the tape and that part of the evaluation that\u2019s clear. But we evaluation that\u2019s clear. But we also want to go full circle and also want to go full circle and make sure it\u2019s so important that make sure it\u2019s so important that the people that we bring in to the people that we bring in to this crew are going to be part this crew are going to be part of an outstanding group, and we of an outstanding group, and we want to make sure every single want to make sure every single thought we can do to add to thought we can do to add to that, we will. And so that\u2019s that, we will. And so that\u2019s much clearer to be able to see much clearer to be able to see that on full display going into that on full display going into this year. It\u2019s obvious that this year. It\u2019s obvious that Peters and Quinn like to build Peters and Quinn like to build this team with guys full of high this team with guys full of high character. I mean, if you go character. I mean, if you go back and look at last year, they back and look at last year, they drafted a number of guys that drafted a number of guys that were captains of their college were captains of their college teams. That is obviously the teams. That is obviously the goal. So is big, strong, goal. So is big, strong, violent. DQ explained that. But violent. DQ explained that. But you know what makes a lot of you know what makes a lot of this easier for Washington? I\u2019m this easier for Washington? I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s easy, but what not saying it\u2019s easy, but what makes it easier having a makes it easier having a quarterback like Jayden Daniels quarterback like Jayden Daniels for so many years, Washington for so many years, Washington was lost in the quarterback was lost in the quarterback abyss. It feels like most of my abyss. It feels like most of my life, Washington was lost in the life, Washington was lost in the quarterback abyss. They have now quarterback abyss.

Thank you, Bill, for the long winded Bill, for the long winded question. Now let\u2019s talk about question. Now let\u2019s talk about this because Dan Quinn got asked this because Dan Quinn got asked and Adam Peters got asked about and Adam Peters got asked about is there any roster flexibility, is there any roster flexibility, position flexibility position flexibility specifically with a guy like specifically with a guy like Brandon Coleman? When Coleman Brandon Coleman? When Coleman was drafted, a lot of NFL was drafted, a lot of NFL experts thought he was going to experts thought he was going to be a guard after the draft pick. be a guard after the draft pick. I heard from folks in Ashburn I heard from folks in Ashburn the following day, he\u2019s a the following day, he\u2019s a tackle. Just watch if you watch tackle. Just watch if you watch Coleman. Over the course of the Coleman. Over the course of the season, a rookie playing left season, a rookie playing left tackle for the majority of the tackle for the majority of the games, he was very good in run games, he was very good in run pass Pro could use some work, pass Pro could use some work, especially late in the year, but especially late in the year, but he had that rookie wall working he had that rookie wall working and he was just beat up. and he was just beat up. Everybody seems to struggle Everybody seems to struggle against the Philly D line now. against the Philly D line now. When DQ got asked, said we\u2019re When DQ got asked, said we\u2019re going to watch with fresh eyes. going to watch with fresh eyes. Now, what that means is if Now, what that means is if there\u2019s another guy that can there\u2019s another guy that can play tackle really well, maybe play tackle really well, maybe we do bump Coleman inside, but we do bump Coleman inside, but they don\u2019t feel there\u2019s a need they don\u2019t feel there\u2019s a need to start moving pieces around to start moving pieces around the Cosby injury. Certainly that the Cosby injury. Certainly that impacts this thing because impacts this thing because you\u2019re not sure Cosby got hurt you\u2019re not sure Cosby got hurt in January. Saints a 910 month in January. Saints a 910 month recovery. You\u2019re probably recovery. You\u2019re probably talking around Halloween it talking around Halloween it we\u2019re just going to have to we\u2019re just going to have to monitor how that injury goes. monitor how that injury goes. Adam Peters did say Sam Cosby\u2019s Adam Peters did say Sam Cosby\u2019s already back in the team\u2019s already back in the team\u2019s Ashburn facilities, working on Ashburn facilities, working on his rehab from the knee injury. his rehab from the knee injury. There\u2019s going to be some moving There\u2019s going to be some moving parts. It\u2019s the offensive line. parts. It\u2019s the offensive line. They always are. I think that\u2019s They always are. I think that\u2019s why offensive linemen in free why offensive linemen in free agency and in the draft are agency and in the draft are going to be a huge focus for going to be a huge focus for this Washington front office. this Washington front office. All right. Question number two. All right. Question number two. What do you got? I\u2019ll try to What do you got? I\u2019ll try to read the whole thing this time. read the whole thing this time. Jay Daniels MVP says do you see Jay Daniels MVP says do you see the Commanders trading Allen for the Commanders trading Allen for Deebo or Kupp. I\u2019m assuming Deebo or Kupp. I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s the full question. This that\u2019s the full question. This is really fascinating. I don\u2019t is really fascinating. I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s going to be a know that there\u2019s going to be a direct player for player swap in direct player for player swap in this kind of thing, because all this kind of thing, because all of the players involved want new of the players involved want new contracts, so they want to be contracts, so they want to be able to negotiate those deals able to negotiate those deals all over the place. I will say all over the place. I will say this, I think if you\u2019re trading this, I think if you\u2019re trading John Allen and it ends up being John Allen and it ends up being a pick swap, say a fifth and a pick swap, say a fifth and John Allen becomes a fourth, I John Allen becomes a fourth, I think you could get Deebo Samuel think you could get Deebo Samuel or maybe even Cooper Kupp for or maybe even Cooper Kupp for about that, because really what about that, because really what the what the Niners and the Rams the what the Niners and the Rams respectively are trying to do is respectively are trying to do is kind of just control that salary kind of just control that salary and move it off their books. And and move it off their books. And I think Deebo in particular, Dan I think Deebo in particular, Dan Quinn, was asked about what kind Quinn, was asked about what kind of things he\u2019s looking for in of things he\u2019s looking for in skill, position players. He said skill, position players. He said violent and they attack their violent and they attack their cuts. Is there a more violent cuts. Is there a more violent wide receiver in the NFL than wide receiver in the NFL than Deebo Samuel? He\u2019s he\u2019s Deebo Samuel? He\u2019s he\u2019s certainly among the top five. So certainly among the top five. So that\u2019s one to watch. Obviously that\u2019s one to watch. Obviously he has deep ties with Adam he has deep ties with Adam Peters as well. Question numero Peters as well. Question numero trace. Let\u2019s do this. What do we trace. Let\u2019s do this. What do we got. Just your average fly guy. got. Just your average fly guy. Alright. If you had to guess, Alright. If you had to guess, are we picking Ebuka at 29, the are we picking Ebuka at 29, the Ohio State wide receiver. I Ohio State wide receiver. I think that\u2019s possible. I think think that\u2019s possible. I think wide outs there. I think pass wide outs there. I think pass rusher remains a really high rusher remains a really high priority for this team. But at priority for this team. But at 29 it\u2019s best player available. 29 it\u2019s best player available. What if Omarion Hampton slips. What if Omarion Hampton slips. Everybody thinks he goes top 15. Everybody thinks he goes top 15. What if he slips. What if What if he slips. What if there\u2019s an early run on corners there\u2019s an early run on corners and you get some of these stud and you get some of these stud interior D lineman at 29, it\u2019s interior D lineman at 29, it\u2019s purely best player available. purely best player available. The only person you\u2019re not The only person you\u2019re not drafting at 29 is a quarterback. drafting at 29 is a quarterback. Let\u2019s get to our last question Let\u2019s get to our last question of the evening. Of course we do of the evening. Of course we do the mailbag every week if you the mailbag every week if you want to be a part of it. Why? want to be a part of it. Why? This is specific to me. Why are This is specific to me. Why are you against the tush? Push. Let you against the tush? Push. Let me be clear on this. I\u2019m not me be clear on this. I\u2019m not against the tush. Push. I think against the tush. Push. I think the Eagles just run a really, the Eagles just run a really, really good version of it. What really good version of it. What I am against is a rule that the I am against is a rule that the NFL changed in 2006. That a NFL changed in 2006. That a runner, a ball carrier, whether runner, a ball carrier, whether it\u2019s a wide receiver or a tight it\u2019s a wide receiver or a tight end, a running back, or in this end, a running back, or in this case, a quarterback in prior to case, a quarterback in prior to 2006, it was illegal to push the 2006, it was illegal to push the ball carrier from behind. I ball carrier from behind. I think that rule should be think that rule should be reinstituted. I think that is reinstituted. I think that is where the danger occurs. And where the danger occurs. And think about how often you see a think about how often you see a running back or a receiver kind running back or a receiver kind of get boggled up in a pile of get boggled up in a pile inside the five, and an inside the five, and an offensive lineman comes running offensive lineman comes running from 20 yards away and blows up from 20 yards away and blows up that pile to try to get that guy that pile to try to get that guy into the end zone. That is into the end zone. That is legitimately dangerous. And if legitimately dangerous. And if the focus is on player safety, I the focus is on player safety, I think that rule change, I think think that rule change, I think you got to reinstitute that. you got to reinstitute that. They can\u2019t be pushed from They can\u2019t be pushed from behind. And I think that will behind. And I think that will have significant impact on the have significant impact on the tush push. Nobody go anywhere. serve. That\u2019s what working for you is. Welcome back to All you is. Welcome back to All Ears, the Indy edition. We are Ears, the Indy edition. We are at the NFL Scouting Combine with at the NFL Scouting Combine with the Commanders brass and brass the Commanders brass and brass from all over the NFL. And why? from all over the NFL. And why? For the for the Commanders at For the for the Commanders at 29, we don\u2019t know who they\u2019re 29, we don\u2019t know who they\u2019re going to pick. And if anybody going to pick. And if anybody starts telling you they know starts telling you they know they\u2019re they\u2019re lying to you. they\u2019re they\u2019re lying to you. Let me be clear. But what about Let me be clear. But what about at the top of this draft? It\u2019s at the top of this draft? It\u2019s pretty darn interesting. Here\u2019s pretty darn interesting. Here\u2019s the weekend line who\u2019s going to the weekend line who\u2019s going to be the top pick? And of course, be the top pick? And of course, you got a quarterback at Cam you got a quarterback at Cam Ward Madden and Abdul Carter. Ward Madden and Abdul Carter. And then just an overall athlete And then just an overall athlete stud, wide receiver, cornerback stud, wide receiver, cornerback Travis Hunter, the Heisman Travis Hunter, the Heisman Trophy winner out of Colorado. Trophy winner out of Colorado. For me, it\u2019s going to be really For me, it\u2019s going to be really fascinating to see what actually fascinating to see what actually happens here. I think Abdul happens here. I think Abdul Carter is the best player in Carter is the best player in this draft, the way he played in this draft, the way he played in the College Football Playoff for the College Football Playoff for those Penn State teams, and he those Penn State teams, and he was injured. He was dominant. was injured. He was dominant. Travis Hunter is an incredible Travis Hunter is an incredible athlete. I think you play him as athlete. I think you play him as a corner and then build out a corner and then build out packages for him as a wideout. packages for him as a wideout. But you know what always gets But you know what always gets over drafted quarterback I think over drafted quarterback I think Cam Ward\u2019s the best one in this Cam Ward\u2019s the best one in this class. I won\u2019t be shocked if any class. I won\u2019t be shocked if any of those guys go top three. of those guys go top three. Tennessee is going to try to Tennessee is going to try to play it cool.

And I think because Garrett\u2019s contract because Garrett\u2019s contract situation is highly complicated situation is highly complicated and the compensation to get and the compensation to get Garrett out of Cleveland also Garrett out of Cleveland also highly complicated. I don\u2019t know highly complicated. I don\u2019t know that anything actually moves on that anything actually moves on that until closer to the NFL. that until closer to the NFL. Draft deadlines drive deals, as Draft deadlines drive deals, as they say in the NFL, and a trade they say in the NFL, and a trade for Garrett is going to be for Garrett is going to be driven by picks, primarily first driven by picks, primarily first round picks. Washington picking round picks. Washington picking at 29 and ideally with Jayden at 29 and ideally with Jayden Daniels as your quarterback, Daniels as your quarterback, picking deep into the 20s for picking deep into the 20s for the next foreseeable years. the next foreseeable years. Maybe you really do make a move Maybe you really do make a move for Garrett, but don\u2019t hold your for Garrett, but don\u2019t hold your breath. That\u2019s going to be a breath. That\u2019s going to be a slow developing situation with slow developing situation with Myles Garrett. Here\u2019s another Myles Garrett. Here\u2019s another thing that is really going to be thing that is really going to be fascinating. It\u2019s the San fascinating. It\u2019s the San Francisco 49 ers quarterback Francisco 49 ers quarterback situation. Let\u2019s get to what situation. Let\u2019s get to what they\u2019re saying because this is they\u2019re saying because this is one of the all time greats Joe one of the all time greats Joe Montana saying what the Niners Montana saying what the Niners should do about Brock Purdy. should do about Brock Purdy. What do you think the Niners What do you think the Niners should do with Brock Purdy. Oh should do with Brock Purdy. Oh you got to pay him I mean, I can you got to pay him I mean, I can show you 4 or 5 guys in the show you 4 or 5 guys in the league making tons of money that league making tons of money that haven\u2019t produced anywhere near haven\u2019t produced anywhere near what he\u2019s been able to do. And what he\u2019s been able to do. And they just had one of those years they just had one of those years where guys are getting hurt where guys are getting hurt offensively, defensively. offensively, defensively. Craziness in the beginning of Craziness in the beginning of the year with, you know, the the year with, you know, the trade talk and trades with the trade talk and trades with the wide receiver. And then he gets wide receiver. And then he gets hurt. They just they just had hurt. They just they just had one of those years. You just one of those years. You just can\u2019t wait to get behind you. can\u2019t wait to get behind you. Yeah just chalk it up yeah. To Yeah just chalk it up yeah. To that move on. But you think that move on. But you think Purdy is the quarterback of the Purdy is the quarterback of the future. And yeah I think he he\u2019s future. And yeah I think he he\u2019s got a good understanding. I got a good understanding. I think one of the things I think one of the things I thought they pressed a little thought they pressed a little bit towards the end every time bit towards the end every time they got behind. So you saw they got behind. So you saw Purdy get sacked more times. Purdy get sacked more times. First of all you got you got First of all you got you got some offensive linemen who are some offensive linemen who are hurt. And so now you\u2019re making hurt. And so now you\u2019re making him hold the ball longer. And him hold the ball longer. And sometimes I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s sometimes I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s only on TV that I can see. And only on TV that I can see. And which I hate to make that which I hate to make that judgment, but when the guy gets judgment, but when the guy gets sacked and I can\u2019t see a wide sacked and I can\u2019t see a wide receiver or any receiver on the receiver or any receiver on the screen there, it looks like screen there, it looks like they\u2019re trying to push the ball they\u2019re trying to push the ball down the field. And that\u2019s not down the field. And that\u2019s not what that\u2019s not what they do. what that\u2019s not what they do. That\u2019s not typically what they That\u2019s not typically what they do. Checking the right wrist. do. Checking the right wrist. Few people as qualified to talk Few people as qualified to talk about San Francisco quarterbacks about San Francisco quarterbacks as Joe Montana before Tom Brady, as Joe Montana before Tom Brady, and before Patrick Mahomes and before Patrick Mahomes started fighting over who the started fighting over who the goat was, it was Montana that goat was, it was Montana that said, you\u2019re going to pay Brock said, you\u2019re going to pay Brock Purdy $60 million, $60 million. Purdy $60 million, $60 million. I don\u2019t think Purdy should be I don\u2019t think Purdy should be judged on his previous draft judged on his previous draft status. Go back. He was Mr. status. Go back. He was Mr. Irrelevant, the last pick of Irrelevant, the last pick of that draft. But he\u2019s really that draft. But he\u2019s really good. But man, that is a lot of good. But man, that is a lot of money to commit to the money to commit to the quarterback position. They got a quarterback position. They got a lot of talent out there in San lot of talent out there in San Francisco. Go back a year. They Francisco. Go back a year. They were a Super Bowl favorite this were a Super Bowl favorite this past year. They missed the past year. They missed the playoffs entirely. It\u2019s playoffs entirely. It\u2019s fascinating to think about fascinating to think about what\u2019s going to happen in San what\u2019s going to happen in San Francisco, where there\u2019s going Francisco, where there\u2019s going to be a lot of moving parts to be a lot of moving parts before the new NFL league year before the new NFL league year opens in the middle of March, opens in the middle of March, and you got to wonder, Adam and you got to wonder, Adam Peters has ties to that Niners Peters has ties to that Niners organization. Now. They\u2019re not organization. Now. They\u2019re not looking at quarterback, but all looking at quarterback, but all over the rest of that roster over the rest of that roster they\u2019re going to be paying they\u2019re going to be paying attention. What about some attention. What about some linebackers that Adam Peters linebackers that Adam Peters knows a thing or two about Dre knows a thing or two about Dre Greenlaw I mean there\u2019s going to Greenlaw I mean there\u2019s going to be a lot of moving parts based be a lot of moving parts based on Purdy getting paid. And on Purdy getting paid. And certainly a big one of them is certainly a big one of them is going to be Deebo Samuel. Deebo going to be Deebo Samuel. Deebo has requested a trade. The has requested a trade. The Niners have said if you can Niners have said if you can figure it out go get it. Here\u2019s figure it out go get it. Here\u2019s Deebo what you missed talking Deebo what you missed talking about where he might end up. about where he might end up. Who\u2019s a team in your opinion Who\u2019s a team in your opinion that people should kind of be that people should kind of be like ooh they might be they like ooh they might be they might be something special. I might be something special. I can say Denver is playing can say Denver is playing really, really good ball right really, really good ball right now. Your defense is outrageous. now. Your defense is outrageous. You got P2 out there. Who\u2019s I You got P2 out there. Who\u2019s I would say the best at the would say the best at the position right now. Probably position right now. Probably been for the past two years. You been for the past two years. You got the other guy on the other got the other guy on the other side. I just think you need a side. I just think you need a couple more pieces and then couple more pieces and then it\u2019ll be what it need to be and it\u2019ll be what it need to be and just have to get past Pat just have to get past Pat Mahomes every year. So that\u2019s Mahomes every year. So that\u2019s Debo talking about Denver. But Debo talking about Denver. But let\u2019s be crystal clear. Debo is let\u2019s be crystal clear. Debo is going to go wherever he gets going to go wherever he gets paid. He\u2019s currently got no paid. He\u2019s currently got no guaranteed money. In the last guaranteed money. In the last year of his deal in San Fran. year of his deal in San Fran. He\u2019s going to look for He\u2019s going to look for opportunity and cash. Washington opportunity and cash. Washington could be one of those teams. could be one of those teams. Certainly. Peters knows Debo Certainly. Peters knows Debo from their time in San Fran. from their time in San Fran. There\u2019s going to be so many There\u2019s going to be so many moving parts. I kind of wanted moving parts. I kind of wanted to pick a few different ones. to pick a few different ones. Just to give you a sense of how Just to give you a sense of how crazy this NFL offseason is crazy this NFL offseason is going to be. And here\u2019s one going to be. And here\u2019s one thing we know about Adam Peters. thing we know about Adam Peters. When he took the job in When he took the job in Washington, he said he wants to Washington, he said he wants to be in on every conversation. be in on every conversation. Doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s going to do Doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s going to do it, but he at least wants to it, but he at least wants to know what the conversation is know what the conversation is about. Now, as we get close to about. Now, as we get close to free agency here, Peters has a free agency here, Peters has a lot of decisions to make. lot of decisions to make. Washington has more than 20 Washington has more than 20 players with expiring contracts. players with expiring contracts. It\u2019s all going to start here It\u2019s all going to start here very, very shortly. So you got very, very shortly. So you got to wonder who are some of the to wonder who are some of the guys Washington has to keep. guys Washington has to keep. Look at this list of players. Look at this list of players. All these contracts expire in All these contracts expire in the middle of March. They\u2019re the middle of March. They\u2019re going to have to figure some going to have to figure some stuff out just to keep a roster stuff out just to keep a roster going. Let\u2019s take a look at some going. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the players I think are most of the players I think are most important for Washington. Let\u2019s important for Washington. Let\u2019s start with Jeremy Chinn. You\u2019re start with Jeremy Chinn. You\u2019re talking about a safety who was talking about a safety who was really good for this Commanders really good for this Commanders defense this year, second in defense this year, second in tackles on the season and just a tackles on the season and just a ferocious downhill player was ferocious downhill player was able to generate some turnovers. able to generate some turnovers. Chinn is the kind of player Chinn is the kind of player because he\u2019s a little bit because he\u2019s a little bit younger. He\u2019s only 27. Maybe younger. He\u2019s only 27. Maybe that\u2019s the guy that gets a that\u2019s the guy that gets a multiyear deal. A lot of these multiyear deal. A lot of these veteran players Washington veteran players Washington signed last offseason, they signed last offseason, they might be looking at another one might be looking at another one year deal. But Chinn, I think year deal. But Chinn, I think you can give him some guaranteed you can give him some guaranteed money into a second season. money into a second season. Great locker room guy. I think Great locker room guy. I think Chinn is somebody they might Chinn is somebody they might prioritize. It\u2019s going to be prioritize. It\u2019s going to be interesting to watch that unfold interesting to watch that unfold because I think he\u2019s around a because I think he\u2019s around a seven, eight, seven, 8 million a seven, eight, seven, 8 million a year guy. Maybe that gets up to year guy. Maybe that gets up to ten. That gets a little too ten. That gets a little too expensive. Now let\u2019s talk about expensive. Now let\u2019s talk about the guy that was the leader of the guy that was the leader of Washington\u2019s defense that is Washington\u2019s defense that is headed for free agency. Bobby headed for free agency. Bobby Wagner, take a look at Wagner. Wagner, take a look at Wagner. Everybody knows he\u2019s a Everybody knows he\u2019s a linebacker. He\u2019s the team linebacker. He\u2019s the team captain type. He had 132 tackles captain type. He had 132 tackles last year. 132 tackles is pretty last year. 132 tackles is pretty darn significant. He played on darn significant. He played on 99% of the snaps for 99% of the snaps for Washington\u2019s defense at age 35. Washington\u2019s defense at age 35. Think about that. Think about Think about that. Think about the longevity of his career. the longevity of his career. Think about the leadership, his Think about the leadership, his relationship with Jayden relationship with Jayden Daniels. I see it in the locker Daniels. I see it in the locker room every day. Those two are room every day. Those two are close. They\u2019re both Southern close. They\u2019re both Southern California guys. They love to California guys. They love to talk about the Lakers and just talk about the Lakers and just trash talk about who could beat trash talk about who could beat who in basketball. I don\u2019t know who in basketball. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve ever played Wagner. I if they\u2019ve ever played Wagner. I don\u2019t know what the money looks don\u2019t know what the money looks like. And I do wonder if Pete like. And I do wonder if Pete Carroll coaching the Raiders is Carroll coaching the Raiders is not going to go after a guy like not going to go after a guy like Wagner, but Wagner is a guy Wagner, but Wagner is a guy you\u2019d like to keep in your you\u2019d like to keep in your building, undoubtedly. Now there building, undoubtedly. Now there are others though, and that\u2019s are others though, and that\u2019s where this is going to get so where this is going to get so complicated. Think about a guy complicated. Think about a guy like Zach Ertz, tight end that like Zach Ertz, tight end that really emerged as an emergency really emerged as an emergency blanket for Jaden. And then just blanket for Jaden. And then just over the course of the season over the course of the season into the playoffs was fantastic. into the playoffs was fantastic. 654 yards, seven touchdowns in 654 yards, seven touchdowns in the regular season. Yes he\u2019s 35. the regular season. Yes he\u2019s 35. But at some point if guys prove But at some point if guys prove they can play on the field, you they can play on the field, you got to bring them back. I don\u2019t got to bring them back. I don\u2019t know what the decision is there know what the decision is there with Ertz. Remember they just with Ertz. Remember they just drafted Ben Senate. Maybe they drafted Ben Senate. Maybe they think he can take a real step think he can take a real step forward be a tight end that can forward be a tight end that can make an offensive dent. He make an offensive dent. He really didn\u2019t do that this past really didn\u2019t do that this past season. Ertz though was a great season. Ertz though was a great guy in that locker room and guy in that locker room and really, really delivered. And really, really delivered. And keep in mind Ertz and offensive keep in mind Ertz and offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury that coordinator Kliff Kingsbury that elected to stay in Washington. elected to stay in Washington. Those two are tight, so I won\u2019t Those two are tight, so I won\u2019t be shocked if Ertz is back. Now be shocked if Ertz is back. Now this one perhaps it\u2019s a little this one perhaps it\u2019s a little personal. There is no way you personal. There is no way you let our guy tress way go. let our guy tress way go. There\u2019s just you can\u2019t do it. There\u2019s just you can\u2019t do it. Trust we must stay here. It\u2019s Trust we must stay here. It\u2019s simple. The people have spoken. simple. The people have spoken. Trust is the people\u2019s punter. Trust is the people\u2019s punter. You want some stats? He\u2019s the You want some stats? He\u2019s the franchise leader in punt yards franchise leader in punt yards and yards per punt all around. and yards per punt all around. Good dude. And I think the Good dude. And I think the people of the DMV would riot if people of the DMV would riot if they saw tress way in another they saw tress way in another uniform. Bring back tress. uniform. Bring back tress. That\u2019s an easy one. Now, we did That\u2019s an easy one. Now, we did post this on my Facebook page, post this on my Facebook page, and we got a bunch of people and we got a bunch of people commenting about what guys they commenting about what guys they want to bring in. Let\u2019s take a want to bring in. Let\u2019s take a look at what some of the folks look at what some of the folks were saying to me. Dan Brown I were saying to me. Dan Brown I don\u2019t mind this one. He said. don\u2019t mind this one. He said. Chin Bobby Wagner Dyami Brown. Chin Bobby Wagner Dyami Brown. They are going to have to sign They are going to have to sign some wide outs here because they some wide outs here because they only have two under contract for only have two under contract for next year. Terry McLaurin and next year. Terry McLaurin and Luke McCaffrey. You really hope Luke McCaffrey. You really hope Luke can make a big jump in year Luke can make a big jump in year two. That will remain to get two. That will remain to get seen, but you\u2019re going to have seen, but you\u2019re going to have to bring more wideouts in. My to bring more wideouts in. My guy Bill Hunsberger I don\u2019t guy Bill Hunsberger I don\u2019t agree with you. Bill Hunsberger agree with you.

I do wonder if at free agency. I do wonder if at the receiver position, they\u2019re the receiver position, they\u2019re not looking, maybe even in the not looking, maybe even in the division. Darius Slayton is a division. Darius Slayton is a guy from the Giants that\u2019s guy from the Giants that\u2019s probably going to be on that probably going to be on that tier two, tier three pricing. tier two, tier three pricing. Look, go down to Jacksonville. Look, go down to Jacksonville.

You know Kirk got the big contract know Kirk got the big contract from the Jags delivered early from the Jags delivered early then dealt with some injuries. I then dealt with some injuries. I do think that\u2019s kind of where do think that\u2019s kind of where you\u2019re going to be shopping. you\u2019re going to be shopping. Look at some of those Cowboys Look at some of those Cowboys defensive players that might be defensive players that might be hitting free agency this year. hitting free agency this year. You know DQ Joe Whitt are going You know DQ Joe Whitt are going to have a good idea of kind of to have a good idea of kind of who what they are on the field who what they are on the field and if they could fit in to this and if they could fit in to this Commanders locker room. It\u2019s Commanders locker room. It\u2019s going to be fun. And the names going to be fun. And the names are going to be coming from all are going to be coming from all over the league, and we\u2019ll start over the league, and we\u2019ll start to get a better idea next week to get a better idea next week in Indy. Let\u2019s get to our next in Indy. Let\u2019s get to our next question here. As everybody is question here. As everybody is gearing up for free agency. Man, gearing up for free agency. Man, this one says I believe we\u2019re this one says I believe we\u2019re going to Brazil. Thoughts? This going to Brazil. Thoughts? This is from someone with the handle is from someone with the handle of Jesus of Nazareth. That seems of Jesus of Nazareth. That seems fairly audacious to make that fairly audacious to make that your Twitter handle, but it\u2019s your Twitter handle, but it\u2019s not up to me. I think it\u2019s not up to me. I think it\u2019s possible. Here\u2019s what we know. possible. Here\u2019s what we know. The LA Chargers are going to The LA Chargers are going to play week one in Brazil, and play week one in Brazil, and it\u2019s going to be a Chargers home it\u2019s going to be a Chargers home game. That game will be Friday game. That game will be Friday night. The Eagles get the home night. The Eagles get the home opener Thursday night, then the opener Thursday night, then the Chargers in Brazil Friday night. Chargers in Brazil Friday night. What I know is Washington plays What I know is Washington plays at Philly next season and at the at Philly next season and at the Chargers. So the Chargers have Chargers. So the Chargers have made the Brazil game their home made the Brazil game their home game. It\u2019s entirely possible game. It\u2019s entirely possible Washington\u2019s playing week one in Washington\u2019s playing week one in Sao Paulo. That\u2019s hardly a Sao Paulo. That\u2019s hardly a guarantee. We won\u2019t know guarantee. We won\u2019t know anything for sure until early anything for sure until early May, when the NFL finally May, when the NFL finally releases the schedule, but releases the schedule, but there\u2019s going to be a ton of there\u2019s going to be a ton of speculation about it. One more speculation about it. One more thought, though. Washington also thought, though. Washington also plays at Miami this season. plays at Miami this season. Well, the Dolphins have a home Well, the Dolphins have a home game in Madrid, so it\u2019s not only game in Madrid, so it\u2019s not only possible that Washington could possible that Washington could play at Brazil, it\u2019s possible play at Brazil, it\u2019s possible Washington plays in Spain. They Washington plays in Spain. They won\u2019t play both of those. I won\u2019t play both of those. I don\u2019t think the NFL is going to don\u2019t think the NFL is going to send a team on two different send a team on two different international trips, but lot of international trips, but lot of interesting options. And also interesting options. And also keep in mind, just with keep in mind, just with Washington\u2019s success last year, Washington\u2019s success last year, they\u2019re going to have a ton of they\u2019re going to have a ton of prime time games. So anybody prime time games. So anybody that got tired of Sunday 1:00 that got tired of Sunday 1:00 last year, you\u2019re not going to last year, you\u2019re not going to be tired of it this year. All be tired of it this year. All right. Up next, Joel Erickson right. Up next, Joel Erickson checks in, says have you heard checks in, says have you heard anything about uniform changes anything about uniform changes or when what we can expect from or when what we can expect from them? I don\u2019t know, I do believe them? I don\u2019t know, I do believe generally you have to wait five generally you have to wait five years before you make a years before you make a significant uniform change. But significant uniform change. But I do think the NFL allows for I do think the NFL allows for some leeway and perhaps some some leeway and perhaps some exemptions to that rule when exemptions to that rule when there\u2019s an ownership change. there\u2019s an ownership change. Josh Harris has been very clear Josh Harris has been very clear he\u2019d like to get back to the he\u2019d like to get back to the more classic uniforms. For me, I more classic uniforms.

about her Olympic experience and her next chapter. The DMV is home to one of the best hurdlers in the world, and she is in our studio. A gold medal champion of women\u2019s track and field from the 2024 Paris Olympics who came to share her next chapter. So joining us in the studio from Potomac, Maryland, a Potomac, Maryland native, Bullis School alum, Gold Medal winner Masai Russell, thank you so much for being here with us. Hello. Hello. Thank you. I love your sweater with the Olympic rings and more importantly, the medal that you have around your neck. Yes You want to see it? I want to see it. And I want to touch it because I\u2019ve heard how heavy. Yes, it really is heavy. That\u2019s the part of the tower. Oh, yeah. That\u2019s the part of the Eiffel Tower. And then on the other side, this is just like the traditional, Olympic. Just how all the medals are. So this is like its own personal side, like, for Paris. But, yeah, this is a piece of the Eiffel Tower with my gold. Has it all sunk in yet? I mean, for you to be part of such an elite group of athletes, number one and so many DMV athletes who brought home gold, who brought home medals? Gold medal. Yeah. Has it sunk in? It actually hasn\u2019t. I mean, I worked my whole entire life for this moment. It\u2019s not even realistic. So the fact that it\u2019s real, it happened. I\u2019m only 24 years old. It\u2019s like. It\u2019s just insane. I really can\u2019t say anything about it. And that moment was so incredible. It was so close, so close. 1\/100 of a second to win in the 100 meter hurdles. Does that replay in your head like, oh my goodness, because it really it\u2019s incredible. Not really. And the only reason why I say that is because I\u2019ve actually been in closer races like when I made the world championship team last year, me and the other competitor, we ran the same exact time. But this time, I mean, yes, it was 1\/100 of a second, but like, you know, like I won because I ran 1233 and then she ran 1234. So it was a little distinction, but it was still a very close race. But I\u2019m just glad that, you know, I got the gold. We\u2019re very glad you got the gold. You dreamed of this. You prayed for this. You said, you know, when you fell on that, that last year you would be back. And this all played out and came true. You were there in Paris and so was Quincy Wilson, both with bullets in your. Yes, in your DNA, in your family, in terms of, in your community. Did you guys talk about it there? What did you say to each other? Well, for me personally, I was more of just like trying to make sure that he was good, just being that mentor, because he was 16 years old. And I know what it\u2019s like to be on a global team around a whole bunch of 24, 25, 26, even 30 year olds. So I\u2019m like, just making sure that he was kind of good because I know how I felt on my first team. I was 17 years old and I was around a lot of 17 year olds, but I was still very nervous to be around other people, not really around my parents. So for me, I was just trying to make sure that he was good because I know what it\u2019s like to be the younger person on the team and I was just like, wait, we\u2019re really putting Maryland on the map? Like it was crazy just because we went to the same high school and he\u2019s still in high school. It\u2019s crazy. But I went to Bullis and then the fact that he\u2019s at Bullis now and just putting bullets on the map on a global stage, it\u2019s just crazy. Like it\u2019s just it\u2019s surreal, just promises to be in LA in 2028. Promise. That\u2019s crazy. But I mean, I mean, I guess my promise too. That\u2019s what I want to know. That\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna promise. Because I\u2019m like, the streak starts now. I already got the first gold. It\u2019s like, why not keep the next two Olympics going? Yes. And between now and then, I want you to get some rest and enjoy your family and your friends. And that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do. Oh I will, that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to be doing. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to be doing. I got one more meet next Thursday, and then after that I don\u2019t want to see, talk about, touch, smell, attract, nothing. Masai Russell.

gold. News 4\u2019s Aimee Cho has more on her emotional journey to Paris. If you ask Sydney Satchel how the Paralympics went, it was literally a dream and I\u2019m still, I think I\u2019m still asleep at night. She\u2019s been working toward that dream for years. Sydney was that dream for years. Sydney was part of the U.S. women\u2019s sitting volleyball team, defeating China, three one, in the finals to take home gold. How beautiful these Paralympic Games have been. And then to reach the part where my team accomplished our goal to win gold. Words cannot express how I\u2019m feeling right now. She\u2019s overcome a lot along the way. Sydney previously played lacrosse at Howard University and had hoped to be the first black woman on the U.S. lacrosse team at the Olympics. But in 2015, she was driving along an icy road and hit a tree, pinning her left leg in the door. Doctors did several painful surgeries to try to save her leg. Just the realities of life and death and just all the turmoil, the storms, the joy that I have endured through to get to moments like these. Sydney eventually made the difficult choice to amputate her leg. Doctors told her as she was being wheeled into the operating room, she was singing a song about being a champ. Just about being a champion, overcoming hard things. And so today I stand as a champion, a gold medalist. If you will. Sydney says she hopes to continue her journey to LA 2028, but for now, she\u2019s soaking in the celebrations and didn\u2019t expect to be here. When I was that little girl hoping to be in the Olympics.

love First Baptist. Glenarden always coming out supporting the community. Let\u2019s go ahead and take a live look at Paris right now as the Paralympics heading into the final few days. But, you know, speaking of the Olympics, after helping Team USA win gold in women\u2019s soccer, the Washington spirits forward Trinity Rodman is reflecting on her time at the Olympics. I caught up with her to talk about all things Paris and also preview this weekend\u2019s match when Rodman will take the pitch against some of her Olympic teammates. Well, you\u2019ve had quite the year. Quite the past couple of months. What has it just been like? I think what it looks like on the outside is pretty similar to what it looks like up here. It\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s back to back to back everything. I feel like you\u2019re almost trying to keep up with your own schedule, but for me, at the end of the day, like this whole experience, this whole season has been very hard. And I\u2019ve worked really hard. But at the same time, it\u2019s been so much fun and I wouldn\u2019t trade it for the world. But yeah, getting the gold is obviously the cherry on top. But now we\u2019re back with spirit and now we\u2019re focused on the championship. What was that three weeks like for you between having the group play in the south of France, coming into Paris and getting all the way to the championship game for your first Olympics, what was that like? Yeah, I mean, I had no expectations. I think going into the World Cup, I put a lot of expectations in my head and going into this tournament, I kind of changed my mindset and altered that to just go in and do my job and just learn. It was just kind of whatever my role is going to be. With Emma coming in, it hasn\u2019t been that long. I\u2019m just going to adapt and kind of go on the fly. We have a proposal for our trio name to be Triple Espresso, so we\u2019re just going to put that out into the air and let people run with that. Triple espresso. The, you know, you all just seem like you were having a ton of fun. But also, I mean, it was showing up on the field. You all were scoring goals. What is just your relationship like with those two other women? And how special was it for you all to be in Paris together? It was so fun. And I think, like you said, you could see the connections and they\u2019ve gotten better every single camp. But I think, too, what I\u2019ve learned is in big tournaments, you kind of throw the I\u2019m trying to beat you out. I\u2019m trying to be in your position. And it\u2019s just we\u2019re working to make each other better. Triple espresso was thriving. Very happy, yeah. Those are my girls. We\u2019ve gotten so close. And having an experience like that together. And with all of us having different routes to get there and to all have the same celebratory ending was so great. And yeah, again, I love them. So there\u2019s a little bit of a reunion on Saturday.

native Nicole Yergen is Maryland native Nicole Yergen is an Olympian who competed with Team Great Britain in Paris, and she brought home two bronze medals as part of the four by 400m relay teams. Nicole graduated from Bishop McNamara High School in Forestville and ran track at USC. If you\u2019re wondering why Team Great Britain, her mother, is Scottish, Nicole joins us now in studio to talk about her incredible experience. Thanks so much for joining us. Great to see you and congratulations. Thank you. So you didn\u2019t just go to Paris to win. You won two Olympic medals. And tell us about some of your most cherished memories from your time there. You know, I think especially compared to Tokyo, there was just so much more to do. My family was there, my friends were there in the crowd. So I got to see them after and just bring home medals. Just makes it even more special. Yeah, it makes such a big deal when you have them with you. Yes. And what was it like to compete against some of your fellow track mates at USC? Right. Oh, yeah. It was so awesome. My training partner, I actually went to USC with her and we were somehow get in the same race at the same leg each Olympics, so it was nice to have her with me. That is so unique, right? How cool is that? You\u2019ve been home now I know you\u2019re probably still processing everything that\u2019s happened. What have you been up to? I know you\u2019re catching up with friends and family. I\u2019ve kind of just doing other stuff, making appearances. I went to the Orioles game last week. I\u2019m going to the Washington Spirit women\u2019s soccer game this weekend so it\u2019s been fun just hanging out with family and just relaxing for a little bit. And we saw that you\u2019re hanging out with other fellow elite athletes to Serena Williams. Tell us about that. Oh my gosh. Yes. That was such a great moment, just getting a chance to be with her and hang out with her and talk to her. She was really excited to see me, which was really awesome. You know, I was like, oh, you know who I am? Like, it was really, really cool. So special. And what is that like? Do you feel different coming back, I think it\u2019s starting to hit a little bit as I, you know, come on here and talk to you and do the other appearances. It\u2019s hitting a little bit, but I think it\u2019s just, you know, the season starts in about three weeks again. So you\u2019re back at it. Yeah. Back at it. This is such an interesting fact that I didn\u2019t know you were a kicker for your high school football team. Yes. That is incredible. Yeah. So tell us, looking back, did that experience help you in any way to compete on the world stage? What was that like for you? It was I think that was more nerve wracking than competing on the world stage, because I prepare to get onto the stage and, you know, we train all season for this. It\u2019s like, I think, but being on a men\u2019s football team, it\u2019s like there\u2019s so much pressure. Like you have to score the point, you know, you never know when your time is going to come. I know when I\u2019m going to run every time. It\u2019s pretty easy. But on the men\u2019s soccer team, it\u2019s like or men\u2019s football team, it\u2019s very, very nerve wracking. And so that so in fact then you were really ready. The Olympics was nothing. You were like, listen, I played on a men\u2019s football team. Now I\u2019m ready to go. Oh yeah, it\u2019s funny, the crowd, like the loudness of the crowd, kind of helps. Like ease out your nerves. And I don\u2019t know, you just get out there and you\u2019re, like, taking in the moment. It\u2019s not really that nerve wracking. I was going to ask you about that. What is your method when you\u2019re preparing to be on the track and run? Do you? You\u2019re just focused. You know, I think you go through your race plan each time, but also being on the relay, you can\u2019t really have a race plan. You know, it\u2019s kind of what happens in the race. So I\u2019m sitting there. I usually run third or last so I can sit there and watch the race and watch all my teammates go one by one and I\u2019m like, all right, I know what I have to do. I either have to run faster, I have to hold. I\u2019ve got to wait. You know, it\u2019s kind of like, you know, it\u2019s a game, you know, interesting. And so now you said you\u2019re back at it in three weeks. What\u2019s that going to look like for you? Fall training starts in three weeks. That\u2019s the hardest part of track. And field, to be honest. In season it\u2019s pretty easy. You\u2019re just competing and all the hard work and your base foundation comes from the fall. So we\u2019ll step it up each week and it\u2019ll get harder. But it\u2019s basically like death training for sure. Are you ready? Do you feel like you\u2019ve had enough time after Paris? Oh yeah.

ThatI.. History was made at the Paris Olympics. Bullies, high school rising junior Quincy Wilson not only became the youngest male U.S. Olympian in track and field history, he also now holds the title of youngest Olympic track and field gold medalist. Quincy Wilson is here along with his bullies, high school track coach Joe Lee live in studio to talk about their incredible experience. Welcome to both of you guys. Thank you. Welcome, welcome, welcome. First of all, like before we get to anything else you have on that gold medal Doug was talking about. Let me just ask you to be 16 years old. You\u2019ve been on the national stage before winning national championships in track and field since you were like nine years old. What was this like this time? To actually get to Paris and then run, so actually, one of the runners that were on the team, they told me that I took their I took their advice the whole way. They said, take it like it\u2019s a regular meet and act like it is a national championship meet, because it will have bigger people, bigger supporters. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s still a track and it\u2019s nine lanes and you\u2019re just going to have to go out there and run. So that\u2019s what I was able to do and that was the most important advice that I got. And without that advice, I don\u2019t know if I would be right here standing next to you. So I\u2019m so thankful I got that advice. And so it was just like I would take it as another race, but it was on a way, way bigger stage. I know when you first found out you were going to get to go, you didn\u2019t know for sure yet. If you actually get to run on the relay team, what was it like to be out there with those Olympians, people who\u2019ve been running on this kind of stage for years? It was crazy. It was crazy just being in that environment, you know, you wouldn\u2019t even think I would be here at 16 and things like that. But I\u2019ve had a great support system. My coach, my parents, everybody, Bullis family, just being able to support me. And I was able once I got that call and I called, I was able to go just like, okay, we\u2019re going to have to run now. And so the practice ramped up, everything amped up. So I just had to go out there and show show what I was made of, really. Speaking of coach, you got your coach here from Bullis. Joe, what was it like for you? You\u2019ve been coaching Quincy for several years now. What was it like when you found out, or did you have any doubt that he was going to end up at the Olympics, yeah. This wasn\u2019t the plan when we started out the season. Like I say, you know, we\u2019re going to go to conference, go to nationals and the Olympic Games, right? That wasn\u2019t the plan. But I mean, he kept running faster and kept improving. And so when we saw we had a chance, we said, all right, well, let\u2019s start to put this in the plan. And everything worked out phenomenally. He did his best as he always does. And, you know, we wound up at the Olympics and being the youngest ever was was pretty exciting to see. And everyone was excited and I was proud of him. Absolutely. We were all proud of you. We were all cheering as we you watched that that four by 400 meter relay when you realize that the USA was going to cross the line first, did it hit your mind that you were going to get a gold medal? No, it didn\u2019t until they crossed the line. They actually crossed, crossed, crossed the line like they had to take it in like a couple minutes. Actually, later, when they were running around and Bryce Deadmon came and gave me my medal because they didn\u2019t I wasn\u2019t able to get on the podium right then and there, but Bryce Deadmon came and gave me the middle. I was like, oh my goodness, this is a gold medal around my neck. And it\u2019s not just a regular nationals or Conference gold medal, it\u2019s an Olympic medal that weighs 6 pounds around my neck. That\u2019s how heavy it is. Yes, it\u2019s 6 pounds. Yes. Wow, so you met a lot of different athletes. What were what were some of the highlights for you? We saw you in the opening ceremony. We saw some of your pictures out there with some of the NBA All Stars who were playing on the basketball team. What were some of the highlights for you, so actually, when we got on the boat, yes, I did, I got to see LeBron James and that was the main thing that I wanted to see. I told everybody they said, who are you most looking forward to seeing? And I said, LeBron James. I got to meet one of them. He actually knew who I was and I actually got to talk to him. So that was one of the that was one of the craziest things that I can say that it was it\u2019s amazing. Like, I forget just LeBron. You\u2019ve gotten a tweet now from Magic Johnson, one of the owners of the Commanders who says, come watch in our studio. And then yesterday you met Jay-Z. Yes, ma\u2019am. What has this been like? Right. We\u2019re watching you right now. This is you meeting Jay-Z right now at the Fanatics Fest in New York City over the weekend? Yes, ma\u2019am. It\u2019s crazy, you know, you walking through, and everybody\u2019s just like, there\u2019s Jay-Z but me. I\u2019m starstruck. My parents are starstruck. Everybody starstruck. And so, you know, 16 years old. But not just 16 years old. Anybody, even my coach right now, just like he was, he was there. I\u2019m a hater. Trust me. I\u2019m a everybody wish we were there. So it was amazing just to be able to be in their presence. And Magic Johnson. Yes. Did sweet. And so now Jayden Daniels got named the quarterback. So now I\u2019ll be able to go to the now I\u2019ll be able to go to the game. I am going to the game in one of these games. Yeah, absolutely, what\u2019s next? And let me ask you, this is just Olympics number one. You\u2019re only 16. How many more Olympics do you think? Do you, do you plan you think? Do you, do you plan to be a part of? I hopefully I\u2019ll be able to go five, five, five Olympics in total. Five. Yes ma\u2019am. Okay. I\u2019m here for that. Speaking I believe it. Speak it out there. And last but not least, coach, I should say not even least real quick. You also coached Masai Russell when she was at Bullis. What is it like to see two athletes that you coached walking with gold medals now on such a humongous stage? I mean, it\u2019s a dream come true. It really still feels like a dream. I\u2019m like, is this really happening? You know, small school in Potomac, Maryland. And then we started our program about ten years ago, and we just kind of built it and have amazing athletes like Masai and Quincy and so many others. It really makes you proud. And they\u2019re just not good athletes. They\u2019re great people. So we\u2019re super proud of them. And that makes all the difference in the world. Okay, they\u2019re telling us we have to wrap. It\u2019s been a pleasure to have you both here. Quincy, can I can I can I hold your gold medal? It\u2019s heavy. It is heavy right there. It\u2019s pretty heavy. All right.

the third I\u2019ll get it right. No you\u2019ll still be trying to figure it out. There you go. Speak from experience. All right. Well, the Olympic Games may be over, but there is still a lot of action coming up in Paris. A Harvard University. Excuse me, a Howard University grad is getting ready to make her debut at the Paralympics. Sydney Satchell plays volleyball. She\u2019s such an inspiration. News 4\u2019s Aimee Cho inspiration. News 4\u2019s Aimee Cho has more now on her emotional journey. Nice nice. Countless hours of practice on the road to Paris, a seated volleyball player, Sydney Satchell, gets ready for her big debut at the Paralympics this is happening. I\u2019m actually about to live a childhood dream of playing at the highest level that I could possibly play. Sydney played lacrosse at Howard University and had hoped to be the first black woman on the U.S. lacrosse team at the Olympics. But in 2015, she was driving along an icy road and hit a tree, pinning her left leg in the door. Doctors did several painful surgeries to try to save her leg. With the grace of God, with his piece, I made a decision to amputate and it has been the best decision of my life. Sydney had never played volleyball before, but she\u2019d always loved watching it at Howard and decided to give it a try. She quickly fell in love, joining the U.S. National team in 2019. Some people ask me, they say, if you could do it all over again, and if you could have your leg back, your foot back, really, would you do it? And the answer is no. I have, so much zeal.

all right. Woo hoo! There you go. There she is. All right. Look at that. The most decorated U.S. women\u2019s Olympian, 14 U.S. women\u2019s Olympian, 14 medals, the most decorated. Do people know who she is? Wait, drew, see if you can get her. See if you can get her. Yes. Can you grab her? Congratulations, Katie. I\u2019m Drew. We\u2019re live on NBC 4 right now. How does it feel to be back home? Oh, it feels great. I haven\u2019t gotten a lot of time back in D.C. over the past year, so I\u2019m excited to have a little bit of downtime here. We\u2019re excited to have you back. Now returning to the US as the most decorated female American Olympian of all time. Has that sunk in yet? What\u2019s that like? No, it hasn\u2019t really sunk in. I got a week in Paris after my last race, and I got to enjoy a lot of the Olympic experience, so, it\u2019s still been a whirlwind, and I\u2019m excited to just relax. Now, are you going to take a little time off? Are you going to get back in the pool soon? I think I\u2019ll probably get back in the pool at some point. Pretty, pretty darn soon, but I\u2019m trying to take a take a breather right now and ease back into it. So, you know, when I fly international, I go through customs and they ask me if I\u2019ve brought back anything that I didn\u2019t leave with fruits or vegetables. Is there a box on their form for, gold? Silver, bronze medals from the Olympics? No, no, not quite, but you don\u2019t have to declare those. I am bringing back more than I came with. That\u2019s for sure. We\u2019re so proud of you. It was so much fun to watch you. Congratulations. Thank you for representing the DMV in our country so well. Katie Ledecky. Awesome. Was that. Oh my gosh, you guys, what an awesome moment. And just look at it out there. Just describe this for us drew. We could see people swarming around her just trying to get autographs. Look at that. Yes. Yeah. Ambrose showed this, there\u2019s like a printed. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a painting, but it\u2019s like, see this guy with the, in the box there, he\u2019s got, like, a hand. It looks like it\u2019s a painting of Ledecky in the pool. He\u2019s trying to get an autograph of that. I mean, people are walking away with their hands shaking with the nerves. I mean, this is just so awesome to see what a powerful moment. I hope again, that she feels the amount of love that our entire country, especially those of us here in the DMV, have felt and tried to express as she has represented us so, so well. This is so wonderful. This is this is phenomenal. It\u2019s something to see. I have to imagine that for her, this reaction from the from from her fellow Americans has got to be just as, just as, as fulfilling as actually putting that medal around her neck. Absolutely. I mean, you know, what an accomplishment to be the most decorated female Olympian athlete and then to come back home, your hometown area and be swarmed by the love from all of the fans, how exciting is that? And this is going to be her life. Oh yeah, this is going to be her life. Well, it\u2019s been her life. It just continues. Yeah, yeah, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s tired and ready to go home and sleep in her own bed. So she got her own little special escort there. Now she\u2019s being whisked away. But what a moment. What a wonderful moment to be able to see her come home and be embraced by by her, her fellow DMV. Oh my gosh, and by her fellow Americans. Drew. What was that like? That was so cool. That was so cool. It was amazing. I mean, that was I I\u2019m starstruck. Honestly. I\u2019m starstruck. I\u2019m such a huge Katie Ledecky fan that that was so cool for me personally. But I\u2019m looking at all these kids around here looking up at her and feeling that like inspiration, right? Like say, oh my gosh, like, you know, she\u2019s gone to the same mall I\u2019ve went to. Maybe some of them went to the same school, like having that moment for some of these kids has to be so special and again, I think that as we were talking about how she kind of feels, that love that we\u2019ve all had and the admiration that we\u2019ve had for her watching her, I think those are probably those moments where it really pops. You know, some of these kids who are looking up to her and idolizing her, you know, like when we were youngsters. I mean, I grew up looking at Michael Jordan and some of these, you know, amazing athletes. I mean, to see somebody like that walk by is just so inspirational and so powerful to realize like, oh my gosh, like, yes, they are an international superstar. But here they are right here in front of me. Drew, let me ask you, was Katie wearing any of her medals? We didn\u2019t look, did we. No medals. Did not. No medals. She was not okay. All right, all right. She was not. That\u2019s what we were joking. You know, it\u2019s like if you\u2019re if you\u2019re Quincy, she has so many. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re kind of joking. Like are they going to be wearing their medals? And I was thinking I was like, okay, if I\u2019m Quincy Wilson and I\u2019m 16 years old and it\u2019s my first one, I\u2019m absolutely wearing my medal. You\u2019re wearing everywhere for at least the next few months. But if you\u2019re Katie Ledecky, you might, you know. Yeah, it\u2019s old hat now. After it\u2019s so, so get to number 14. She\u2019s got a few. It\u2019s kind of ho hum by the time you get to 14 I. Yeah, I know right. I saw this other crazy stat today that NBC Olympics had shared that, that if the American women were their own country, they alone would have won the third most medals. Wow. Like, think about that. Like how incredibly talented our American female athletes are and how incredibly they performed over in Paris that the female Americans alone would have beat pretty much every other country at the Olympics in total medal count. It\u2019s just it\u2019s just so incredible. It was such a fun game in a very real sense. And this was this was the title nine Olympics. And for anyone who may have argued against that, well, I guess that case is now officially proved itself today. Yeah, I was hoping we would get a glimpse here of Quincy Wilson, the 16 year old that attends the Bullet School with all that crowd that was around Katie. No way they would have. They would have known him. And as as drew mentioned, he\u2019s probably wearing his gold medal. He becomes the youngest Olympian in history to get a gold medal. Of course, we know that he was able to run one of the legs of the men\u2019s four by 400 meter qualifying heats, which would actually get the U.S. men into the finals, where they won that incredible. They ran that incredible race to earn the gold medal. Wow. I mean, just what a what a moment it will be like for him to come back and go back to regular life as a 16 year old, a junior in high school, he\u2019s going to go to high school. Yeah, he\u2019s got to go to high school a couple of weeks after performing in a in a in an arena with 150,000 people, he\u2019s got to go to high school and get training for the next Olympics, which will be right here in Los Angeles. All right, drew, keep your eyes open and keep that camera rolling. We want to see what the scene looks","video_id":"2363017283574","video_length":"396630","video_provider":"mpx","short_video_excerpt":"","show":"","event":"","genre":"","mpx_download_pid_mobile_low":"jyLayxaA4NJ1","pid_streaming_web_mobile_low":"","mpx_download_pid_mobile_standard":"Ov4sP96ULIj5","pid_streaming_mobile_standard":"zaySsOqrYWjJ","media_pid":"I91C9W34Oh43","alleypack_schedule_unpublish":"","footnotes":"","feed_remote_id":"mpx_2363017283574","feed_thumbnail_url":""},"category_names":{"223863":"News","569":"Local"},"tag_names":{"497034":"2024 Paris Olympics","500945":"sports"},"custom_data":{"ContentPartner":"None","Source":"NBC","SyndicationAllowed":"true","mSNVideoCategories":"MSN Video v4 Connector-most watched news","mSNVideoContentSupplierID":"NBC_Local","mSNVideoCountry":"us","subtitle":"nosubtitle","uploadedByTeam":"1","youtubeChannel":"None","sentiment":"Positive","topic":"Sports"},"disableEmbed":false},"share_links":{"facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcwashington.com%2Fnews%2Flocal%2Fkatie-ledecky-receives-warm-welcome-from-dmv-at-dulles-airport%2F3692607%2F&amp;Katie%20Ledecky%20receives%20warm%20welcome%20from%20DMV%20at%20Dulles%20Airport","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=Katie%20Ledecky%20receives%20warm%20welcome%20from%20DMV%20at%20Dulles%20Airport&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcwashington.com%2Fnews%2Flocal%2Fkatie-ledecky-receives-warm-welcome-from-dmv-at-dulles-airport%2F3692607%2F","email":"mailto:?body=Katie%20Ledecky%20receives%20warm%20welcome%20from%20DMV%20at%20Dulles%20Airport%0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcwashington.com%2Fnews%2Flocal%2Fkatie-ledecky-receives-warm-welcome-from-dmv-at-dulles-airport%2F3692607%2F","native":"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcwashington.com%2Fnews%2Flocal%2Fkatie-ledecky-receives-warm-welcome-from-dmv-at-dulles-airport%2F3692607%2F"},"bylines":[],"active-contest":null,"profile_contact_info":{"email":"","twitter":"","facebook":"","instagram":""},"content_blocks":[],"team":[],"nbc_attributes":{"size":"S"},"syndication":{"nationalized":false,"syndicated":false,"syndicated_out":false,"linked":true,"id":"","site_id":""},"object_sensitivity":"","excerpt_link_display":{},"originating_market":"Washington DC","originating_site_id":14,"originating_call_letters":"WRC","originating_brand":"nbc","freewheel_policy_id":"39065300","excerpt":"Ledecky told News4 \u201cit hasn\u2019t really sunk in\u201d that she\u2019s the most decorated American female Olympian.

is in Paris now with an update on two wrestlers and two track stars. Two Maryland wrestlers bringing home two more medals for Team USA. We\u2019re talking about Hagerstown native Aaron Brooks and Rockville native Helen Maroulis. They both are bringing home bronze medals now. For Brooks, it\u2019s his very first Olympic medal for Maroulas. It\u2019s her third medal. So we spoke to both of these wrestlers after they got off the mat. Yeah, a lot of lot of emotions the past 24 hours. Can\u2019t question God. So just coming out continuing to represent him the best I can compete hard regardless. And, it paid off. So many emotions. There\u2019s highs and there\u2019s lows.

they\u2019re the ones watching, right. That\u2019s why. That\u2019s why they\u2019re so good at what they do because of Covid, no fans were allowed during the Olympics in Tokyo. I remember that it was very strange, including family, and that was all changed, of course, for the Paris Olympics. Hundreds of friends and family members made the journey to the City of Light to cheer on the world\u2019s best athletes, and our Jummy Olabanji caught up with some of the local moms of Team some of the local moms of Team USA Oh my God. Keisha Caine Bishop loves to cheer on everyone on Team USA, even if the reason she\u2019s in Paris is to support her own son. Olympic gold medalist Noah Lyles. It\u2019s just been a crazy journey because since the Olympic trials, I lost my aunt Noah and Josephus lost their high school track coach from, Alexandria City High School. So it\u2019s just I\u2019ve had Covid, so, so much has gone on, but we\u2019re gonna make it. Lyles has been outspoken about the depression he dealt with during the Tokyo Olympics. Now he\u2019s back and better than ever with his mother by his side showing up to the track for each one of his races. Anybody who struggled with mental health knows it never goes away. But he\u2019s able to manage manage it significantly better. And so first of all, it\u2019s just excited to have fans because three years ago we had Covid. This year we\u2019re able to have our family come. So it\u2019s a totally different experience and I\u2019m always excited that we get to do life together. Wanda Durant is also happy to be in Paris to cheer on her son, NBA superstar and Prince George\u2019s County native Kevin Durant. I never thought when he started basketball that these would be the heights, that he would, reach. And so I am extremely excited for him. I\u2019m proud of him. And the sky is still the beginning. And it\u2019s been 17 years and he has accomplished so much. Durant made his own history during team USA\u2019s quarterfinal game against Brazil. The Seat Pleasant native passed Lisa Leslie for most points scored in Team USA Olympic basketball history. He now has 489 points in his four Olympic appearances, although his mother says equally as important as the stats is his commitment to his hometown. He wants the community to know that we know where we\u2019ve come from, Prince George\u2019s County and the DMV that is home for us. And that\u2019s where we embrace our community and our families. And they say, you, if we did it, you can do it. And so that\u2019s why we stay in the heart of the community, in the DMV, in Paris.

of this has been so fun to watch. I\u2019ve been loving. I know we don\u2019t want it to stop. We got a few more days like seven. We have to talk about swimming, which just wrapped up two. And Team USA is celebrating 28 total medals in the pool and our local swimmers, including Arlington\u2019s Torri Huske, are the big reason why News 4\u2019s Jummy Olabanji caught up with Torri fresh off winning her fifth medal in Paris it feels amazing. This week has been everything I wanted and more and it\u2019s just been a dream. And it\u2019s just it\u2019s just so amazing. I can\u2019t really put it into words right now. You\u2019re tied with Leon Maher Shawn for the most medals here in Paris. When you took that gap year from Stanford, did you expect that this was on the other side? I didn\u2019t really think necessarily about the result. I just knew that taking taking the gap year that taking taking the gap year was the thing that would best prepare me for the Olympics. And so that\u2019s kind of what I did. I actually had a super rough summer. I mean, the end result was definitely worth it. So I think sometimes a little setback is actually good for you. Between our DMV swimmers, you, Katie Erin Gemmell. Yeah, y\u2019all have about a third of them. Yeah, that\u2019s crazy. How do you feel about that? And just what it means for swimming in the D.C. Metro area? Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s the PVS like zone, which is where we\u2019re all from, is so fast and so dominant. So it I\u2019m not and so dominant. So it I\u2019m not really, like, super duper surprised just because growing up there like the competition was so fierce. And yeah, I mean you also like grew up having Katie Ledecky records all over like the psych sheets and stuff like that. When you look at them. So it\u2019s easy to have that many when you have Katie on your team pulling all the weight for you. So you have five as well.

and familiar faces too. It sure did. Jim Eun, good evening to you. Yes. So we caught up with Valerie Ullman, who just won another gold medal in the discus throw. Then Gabby Thomas, a fan favorite who ran her way into tomorrow\u2019s final of the 200. But of course we were really there to talk to our local guy, right? Alexandria\u2019s Noah Lyles, who finally received his gold medal and took to the podium 24 hours after that big win. Now he was very excited, obviously, to get that gold medal around his neck, but he was already back to work tonight on the track. Tonight was round one of the men\u2019s 200 meter race. That\u2019s a signature event for Noah. As you mentioned. He won the bronze in Tokyo and won the gold at the World Championships last summer and has his old high school in Alexandria gets ready to host a watch party for the 200 meter final later this week. Noah had this to say, hey Alexandria, I\u2019m getting another one and we\u2019re getting many more guys. Thanks for all the support and I know you guys are going to be cheering. I can\u2019t wait to see the videos of the reactions. And as you can see, he is very excited and he is ready for another gold medal. Now another local runner who is in action tonight that we caught up with was Laurel Maryland\u2019s Juliet Whitaker, competing in her first Olympic finals. The women\u2019s 800 meter race. Unfortunately guys did not end how she wanted. She did not make the podium. She placed seventh in that final, but she did tell us, although she\u2019s disappointed, she is still proud to be here in Paris. Yeah, definitely. You know, mixed emotions. So proud of how I put myself in it, and just proud of the whole season in general. So I don\u2019t want this one race to kind of define that whole season. But, you know, definitely a little disappointed. It\u2019s kind of crazy. Like a month ago, I couldn\u2019t even imagine that I\u2019d be here at a final. And now I\u2019m disappointed with getting seventh place. It\u2019s kind of crazy how this sport works, but yeah, I\u2019m just hungry for more. So And you know, I have to say, she is great, great attitude. I know we\u2019re going to see her in four years in Los Angeles. I\u2019m calling it now, but her sister, Isabella Whitaker, still has a chance to get a medal. She is in the relay pool for the women\u2019s 4x4 hundred race that\u2019s coming up later on this week. And then, of course, Noah Lyles competing in the semifinals of the men\u2019s 200. That\u2019s on Wednesday with the final set for Thursday. Hey I\u2019m Jim. Several more days of exciting track and field events. But look I gave you all this shot tonight. I mean, look at that behind us. Goodness It\u2019s crazy. It doesn\u2019t get any more perfect. And I\u2019ll tell you know, his mom deserves a medal for cheering section the loudest. Yes. That was so nice. She does. And one of the most exciting things has been watching your interviews. Jummy. Yeah. These athletes who are from our area, making sure that they connect with you, has been really fun to watch, to. Thanks guys so much.
