So it\u2019s like the holy business? So it\u2019s like the holy grail. Every contractor, every grail. Every contractor, every federal contractor, their whole federal contractor, their whole goal is to get that first goal is to get that first government contract. The numbers government contract. The numbers show just how hard it can be. show just how hard it can be. According to the U.S. Department According to the U.S. Department of Labor, in 2021, minority of Labor, in 2021, minority owned businesses represented 24% owned businesses represented 24% of eligible businesses for of eligible businesses for federal contract awards, but federal contract awards, but were only awarded 3%.

After Trump took 15% by 2025. After Trump took office, the SBA rolled the office, the SBA rolled the target back to 5%. That does target back to 5%. That does bring associated fear and does bring associated fear and does feel like they\u2019re being feel like they\u2019re being abandoned or even targeted. To abandoned or even targeted. To better understand the potential better understand the potential impact on businesses in our impact on businesses in our area, we checked how many area, we checked how many companies are registered under companies are registered under the Small Business the Small Business Administration\u2019s eight, a Administration\u2019s eight, a program to help disadvantaged program to help disadvantaged businesses receive training and businesses receive training and technical assistance to compete. technical assistance to compete. DC Has 159 companies registered DC Has 159 companies registered in Maryland, 631 and Virginia in Maryland, 631 and Virginia 1030. That doesn\u2019t include 1030. That doesn\u2019t include thousands of small businesses thousands of small businesses like Antoine\u2019s that don\u2019t have like Antoine\u2019s that don\u2019t have those registrations. It is rare those registrations. It is rare that you will find any company that you will find any company that is doing well in this, in that is doing well in this, in this country, that in some way this country, that in some way is not benefiting from federal is not benefiting from federal government dollars. Kendra government dollars. Kendra Perkins Norwood is a federal Perkins Norwood is a federal procurement attorney who procurement attorney who represents everyone from large represents everyone from large defense and aerospace defense and aerospace contractors to small, contractors to small, disadvantaged businesses. Do we disadvantaged businesses. Do we still need programs to help still need programs to help these minority businesses and these minority businesses and these women owned businesses these women owned businesses access these opportunities? We access these opportunities? We know that minority owned know that minority owned businesses don\u2019t necessarily businesses don\u2019t necessarily perform financially as well as perform financially as well as majority owned businesses. And majority owned businesses. And so until we see that sort of so until we see that sort of equity across the board, I would equity across the board, I would I would say that programs like I would say that programs like this do need to continue. this do need to continue. Perkins Norwood also fears that Perkins Norwood also fears that without incentives and mentoring without incentives and mentoring programs in place, the black programs in place, the black contractors and in turn the contractors and in turn the black middle class will suffer a black middle class will suffer a tremendous blow. Federal tremendous blow. Federal government contracting has been government contracting has been responsible for wealth responsible for wealth generation in many communities, generation in many communities, particularly the black particularly the black community. It has created the community. It has created the black middle class in many black middle class in many instances. Wiggins says while instances. Wiggins says while the path seems more challenging the path seems more challenging than ever, he is encouraging than ever, he is encouraging business owners to stay the business owners to stay the course. I don\u2019t think you should course. I don\u2019t think you should give up. I think a minority give up. I think a minority business contractor should stay business contractor should stay as a contractor. I think pivot as a contractor. I think pivot is the word of the day, the is the word of the day, the hour, the week and the month. hour, the week and the month. For now, these Northern Virginia For now, these Northern Virginia business owners are trying to business owners are trying to figure out what that looks like figure out what that looks like together, possibly without together, possibly without government work. How can we help government work. How can we help each other survive? New each other survive? New unemployment figures out of unemployment figures out of Virginia this week gave us a Virginia this week gave us a glimpse of how Trump\u2019s cuts are glimpse of how Trump\u2019s cuts are impacting local jobs. More than impacting local jobs. More than 4000 unemployment insurance 4000 unemployment insurance claims were filed for the week claims were filed for the week of March 8th. That\u2019s 80% higher of March 8th. That\u2019s 80% higher than the same time last year. than the same time last year. And keep in mind, while those And keep in mind, while those numbers may cover some federal numbers may cover some federal contractors, independent contractors, independent contractors like Ramona Antoine contractors like Ramona Antoine can collect unemployment because can collect unemployment because they don\u2019t pay into that system. they don\u2019t pay into that system. So let me ask you, I heard the So let me ask you, I heard the word pivot used in in one of word pivot used in in one of those interviews. What do some those interviews. What do some of these business owners plan on of these business owners plan on doing? Will they completely doing? Will they completely pivot to something else, a pivot to something else, a completely different field, or completely different field, or what is what is the next idea what is what is the next idea for them? So they\u2019re trying to for them? So they\u2019re trying to figure that out, right. And I figure that out, right. And I think Antoine is a great example think Antoine is a great example of this, that she had a number of this, that she had a number of contracts, but the big money of contracts, but the big money came from the federal government came from the federal government contracts that she had. So when contracts that she had. So when they\u2019re talking about pivot, they\u2019re talking about pivot, they\u2019re talking about how can we they\u2019re talking about how can we build something within our build something within our community to sustain us where we community to sustain us where we are not looking for a check that are not looking for a check that may not be coming? This is may not be coming? This is something that we heard a lot of something that we heard a lot of conservatives talking about, conservatives talking about, talking about moving away from talking about moving away from government dependability. And government dependability. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here with a lot of these folks. But with a lot of these folks. But families having very tough families having very tough conversations, like Antoine is conversations, like Antoine is having with her kids about having with her kids about mommy\u2019s business that she worked mommy\u2019s business that she worked so hard to build is not what we so hard to build is not what we thought it was going to be. Now thought it was going to be. Now we have to figure things out, we have to figure things out, and it\u2019s just really tough for a and it\u2019s just really tough for a lot of these families right now.","video_id":"2415938115594","video_length":"417284","video_provider":"mpx","short_video_excerpt":"","show":"","event":"","genre":"","mpx_download_pid_mobile_low":"_aLcVHrinLqG","pid_streaming_web_mobile_low":"","mpx_download_pid_mobile_standard":"58qE2oe4OK05","pid_streaming_mobile_standard":"qffSZWPCNTMO","media_pid":"YTHH2s9fZhVe","alleypack_schedule_unpublish":"","footnotes":"","feed_remote_id":"mpx_2415938115594","feed_thumbnail_url":""},"category_names":{"225083":"Investigations"},"tag_names":{"4744":"News4 I-Team","839":"Trump administration"},"custom_data":{"ContentPartner":"None","Source":"NBC","SyndicationAllowed":"true","mSNVideoCategories":"MSN Video v4 Connector-most watched news","mSNVideoContentSupplierID":"NBC_Local","mSNVideoCountry":"us","subtitle":"nosubtitle","uploadedByTeam":"1","youtubeChannel":"None","sentiment":"Neutral","topic":"Politics"},"title":"Black federal contractors feel impact of spending cuts","url":"https:\/\/www.nbcwashington.com\/investigations\/black-federal-contractors-feel-impact-of-spending-cuts\/3872811\/"},"share_links":{"facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcwashington.com%2Finvestigations%2Fblack-owned-government-contracting-firms-fear-gains-will-be-lost-amid-trump-spending-cuts%2F3873660%2F&amp;Black-owned%20government%20contracting%20firms%20fear%20gains%20will%20be%20lost%20amid%20Trump%20spending%20cuts","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=Black-owned%20government%20contracting%20firms%20fear%20gains%20will%20be%20lost%20amid%20Trump%20spending%20cuts&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcwashington.com%2Finvestigations%2Fblack-owned-government-contracting-firms-fear-gains-will-be-lost-amid-trump-spending-cuts%2F3873660%2F","email":"mailto:?body=Black-owned%20government%20contracting%20firms%20fear%20gains%20will%20be%20lost%20amid%20Trump%20spending%20cuts%0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcwashington.com%2Finvestigations%2Fblack-owned-government-contracting-firms-fear-gains-will-be-lost-amid-trump-spending-cuts%2F3873660%2F","native":"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcwashington.com%2Finvestigations%2Fblack-owned-government-contracting-firms-fear-gains-will-be-lost-amid-trump-spending-cuts%2F3873660%2F"},"bylines":[{"description":"<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Tracee Wilkins is an investigative reporter with the News4 I-Team.&nbsp;She has won an Edward R.

That does bring associated fear and does bring associated fear and does feel like they\u2019re being feel like they\u2019re being abandoned or even targeted. To abandoned or even targeted. To better understand the potential better understand the potential impact on businesses in our impact on businesses in our area, we checked how many area, we checked how many companies are registered under companies are registered under the Small Business the Small Business Administration\u2019s eight, a Administration\u2019s eight, a program to help disadvantaged program to help disadvantaged businesses receive training and businesses receive training and technical assistance to compete. technical assistance to compete. DC Has 159 companies registered DC Has 159 companies registered in Maryland, 631 and Virginia in Maryland, 631 and Virginia 1030. That doesn\u2019t include 1030. That doesn\u2019t include thousands of small businesses thousands of small businesses like Antoine\u2019s that don\u2019t have like Antoine\u2019s that don\u2019t have those registrations. It is rare those registrations. It is rare that you will find any company that you will find any company that is doing well in this, in that is doing well in this, in this country, that in some way this country, that in some way is not benefiting from federal is not benefiting from federal government dollars. Kendra government dollars. Kendra Perkins Norwood is a federal Perkins Norwood is a federal procurement attorney who procurement attorney who represents everyone from large represents everyone from large defense and aerospace defense and aerospace contractors to small, contractors to small, disadvantaged businesses. Do we disadvantaged businesses. Do we still need programs to help still need programs to help these minority businesses and these minority businesses and these women owned businesses these women owned businesses access these opportunities? We access these opportunities? We know that minority owned know that minority owned businesses don\u2019t necessarily businesses don\u2019t necessarily perform financially as well as perform financially as well as majority owned businesses. And majority owned businesses. And so until we see that sort of so until we see that sort of equity across the board, I would equity across the board, I would I would say that programs like I would say that programs like this do need to continue. this do need to continue. Perkins Norwood also fears that Perkins Norwood also fears that without incentives and mentoring without incentives and mentoring programs in place, the black programs in place, the black contractors and in turn the contractors and in turn the black middle class will suffer a black middle class will suffer a tremendous blow. Federal tremendous blow. Federal government contracting has been government contracting has been responsible for wealth responsible for wealth generation in many communities, generation in many communities, particularly the black particularly the black community. It has created the community. It has created the black middle class in many black middle class in many instances. Wiggins says while instances. Wiggins says while the path seems more challenging the path seems more challenging than ever, he is encouraging than ever, he is encouraging business owners to stay the business owners to stay the course. I don\u2019t think you should course. I don\u2019t think you should give up. I think a minority give up. I think a minority business contractor should stay business contractor should stay as a contractor. I think pivot as a contractor. I think pivot is the word of the day, the is the word of the day, the hour, the week and the month. hour, the week and the month. For now, these Northern Virginia For now, these Northern Virginia business owners are trying to business owners are trying to figure out what that looks like figure out what that looks like together, possibly without together, possibly without government work. How can we help government work. How can we help each other survive? New each other survive? New unemployment figures out of unemployment figures out of Virginia this week gave us a Virginia this week gave us a glimpse of how Trump\u2019s cuts are glimpse of how Trump\u2019s cuts are impacting local jobs. More than impacting local jobs. More than 4000 unemployment insurance 4000 unemployment insurance claims were filed for the week claims were filed for the week of March 8th. That\u2019s 80% higher of March 8th. That\u2019s 80% higher than the same time last year. than the same time last year. And keep in mind, while those And keep in mind, while those numbers may cover some federal numbers may cover some federal contractors, independent contractors, independent contractors like Ramona Antoine contractors like Ramona Antoine can collect unemployment because can collect unemployment because they don\u2019t pay into that system. they don\u2019t pay into that system. So let me ask you, I heard the So let me ask you, I heard the word pivot used in in one of word pivot used in in one of those interviews. What do some those interviews. What do some of these business owners plan on of these business owners plan on doing? Will they completely doing? Will they completely pivot to something else, a pivot to something else, a completely different field, or completely different field, or what is what is the next idea what is what is the next idea for them? So they\u2019re trying to for them? So they\u2019re trying to figure that out, right. And I figure that out, right. And I think Antoine is a great example think Antoine is a great example of this, that she had a number of this, that she had a number of contracts, but the big money of contracts, but the big money came from the federal government came from the federal government contracts that she had. So when contracts that she had. So when they\u2019re talking about pivot, they\u2019re talking about pivot, they\u2019re talking about how can we they\u2019re talking about how can we build something within our build something within our community to sustain us where we community to sustain us where we are not looking for a check that are not looking for a check that may not be coming? This is may not be coming? This is something that we heard a lot of something that we heard a lot of conservatives talking about, conservatives talking about, talking about moving away from talking about moving away from government dependability. And government dependability. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here with a lot of these folks. But with a lot of these folks. But families having very tough families having very tough conversations, like Antoine is conversations, like Antoine is having with her kids about having with her kids about mommy\u2019s business that she worked mommy\u2019s business that she worked so hard to build is not what we so hard to build is not what we thought it was going to be. Now thought it was going to be. Now we have to figure things out, we have to figure things out, and it\u2019s just really tough for a and it\u2019s just really tough for a lot of these families right now.","video_id":"2415938115594","video_length":"417284","video_provider":"mpx","short_video_excerpt":"","show":"","event":"","genre":"","mpx_download_pid_mobile_low":"_aLcVHrinLqG","pid_streaming_web_mobile_low":"","mpx_download_pid_mobile_standard":"58qE2oe4OK05","pid_streaming_mobile_standard":"qffSZWPCNTMO","media_pid":"YTHH2s9fZhVe","alleypack_schedule_unpublish":"","footnotes":"","feed_remote_id":"mpx_2415938115594","feed_thumbnail_url":""},"category_names":{"225083":"Investigations"},"tag_names":{"4744":"News4 I-Team","839":"Trump administration"},"custom_data":{"ContentPartner":"None","Source":"NBC","SyndicationAllowed":"true","mSNVideoCategories":"MSN Video v4 Connector-most watched news","mSNVideoContentSupplierID":"NBC_Local","mSNVideoCountry":"us","subtitle":"nosubtitle","uploadedByTeam":"1","youtubeChannel":"None","sentiment":"Neutral","topic":"Politics"},"disableEmbed":false},"share_links":{"facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcwashington.com%2Finvestigations%2Fblack-federal-contractors-feel-impact-of-spending-cuts%2F3872811%2F&amp;Black%20federal%20contractors%20feel%20impact%20of%20spending%20cuts","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=Black%20federal%20contractors%20feel%20impact%20of%20spending%20cuts&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcwashington.com%2Finvestigations%2Fblack-federal-contractors-feel-impact-of-spending-cuts%2F3872811%2F","email":"mailto:?body=Black%20federal%20contractors%20feel%20impact%20of%20spending%20cuts%0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcwashington.com%2Finvestigations%2Fblack-federal-contractors-feel-impact-of-spending-cuts%2F3872811%2F","native":"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcwashington.com%2Finvestigations%2Fblack-federal-contractors-feel-impact-of-spending-cuts%2F3872811%2F"},"bylines":[],"active-contest":null,"profile_contact_info":{"email":"","twitter":"","facebook":"","instagram":""},"content_blocks":[],"team":[],"nbc_attributes":{"size":"S"},"syndication":{"nationalized":false,"syndicated":false,"syndicated_out":false,"linked":true,"id":"","site_id":""},"object_sensitivity":"","excerpt_link_display":{},"originating_market":"Washington DC","originating_site_id":14,"originating_call_letters":"WRC","originating_brand":"nbc","freewheel_policy_id":"39065300","excerpt":"The D.C. area has one of the largest populations of Black wealth in the country due in large part to federal government employment and contracting opportunities, but some worry they\u2019ll see those gains disappear as the region feels the impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s cuts to agency staffing and spending.

So eventually he did end up leaving eventually he did end up leaving his house. And we were able to his house. And we were able to apprehend him before he took apprehend him before he took off. His wife wouldn\u2019t open the off. His wife wouldn\u2019t open the door. We don\u2019t have any reason door.

None have current pending None have current pending criminal charges. So why the criminal charges. So why the early morning operations? You early morning operations? You know, most of our our targets know, most of our our targets work early in the morning, work early in the morning, arresting someone when they\u2019re arresting someone when they\u2019re half asleep at 5:00 in the half asleep at 5:00 in the morning is less. There\u2019s morning is less. There\u2019s statistically there\u2019s less statistically there\u2019s less likelihood that they are going likelihood that they are going to fight back. We know the to fight back. We know the targets that we\u2019re going after, targets that we\u2019re going after, right? We don\u2019t do dragnets. We right? We don\u2019t do dragnets. We don\u2019t go door to door. That\u2019s don\u2019t go door to door. That\u2019s never something that ISIS has never something that ISIS has done. But the difference from done. But the difference from previous administrations, his previous administrations, his team can also make what\u2019s called team can also make what\u2019s called collateral arrests. Undocumented collateral arrests. Undocumented immigrants they come across with immigrants they come across with no criminal charges. We\u2019re still no criminal charges. We\u2019re still targeting that worst of the targeting that worst of the worst person you know. Except worst person you know. Except now if we come across someone now if we come across someone who\u2019s standing next to him, who\u2019s standing next to him, who\u2019s also here illegally, we\u2019re who\u2019s also here illegally, we\u2019re going to take that person, too. going to take that person, too. That happened after agents That happened after agents waited for more than two hours waited for more than two hours near the home of a man from El near the home of a man from El Salvador. Ice says he\u2019s been Salvador. Ice says he\u2019s been convicted of DUI and negligent convicted of DUI and negligent manslaughter. The stakeout is manslaughter. The stakeout is something that could not have something that could not have been done last year, due to a been done last year, due to a 2011 policy that limited them, 2011 policy that limited them, targeting people near sensitive targeting people near sensitive locations such as schools or locations such as schools or churches. But that policy was churches. But that policy was rescinded in January by DHS. rescinded in January by DHS. This building behind us is a This building behind us is a Baptist church. You know, Baptist church. You know, despite us not doing anything at despite us not doing anything at the church like we wouldn\u2019t even the church like we wouldn\u2019t even be allowed to be parked in a be allowed to be parked in a parking lot, really, anywhere parking lot, really, anywhere within like a two block radius within like a two block radius of here.

So he\u2019s been removed from the United States removed from the United States previously. Look, my family, my previously. Look, my family, my kids. Understand? You got to go. kids. Understand? You got to go. This is a total change and an This is a total change and an escalation in how immigrants are escalation in how immigrants are being treated. Attorney Michael being treated. Attorney Michael Lukens is with Amica Center for Lukens is with Amica Center for Immigrant Rights. It works to Immigrant Rights. It works to help detainees know their help detainees know their rights. I think what really rights. I think what really concerns me is you don\u2019t look at concerns me is you don\u2019t look at someone who was born in the someone who was born in the United States who had a criminal United States who had a criminal background and say, well, they background and say, well, they are a criminal forever, right? are a criminal forever, right? You don\u2019t label them a criminal You don\u2019t label them a criminal and make them a second class and make them a second class citizen. Why is it okay to do citizen. Why is it okay to do that for an immigrant? Tensions that for an immigrant? Tensions are definitely much, much higher are definitely much, much higher among Frimpong with the among Frimpong with the immigrant advocacy group Casa immigrant advocacy group Casa says. There\u2019s a lot of fear says. There\u2019s a lot of fear right now, especially for right now, especially for families who might lose a parent families who might lose a parent or breadwinner to deportation. I or breadwinner to deportation. I see, you know, moms, right, who see, you know, moms, right, who are trying to console their are trying to console their kids, right? And, you know, kids, right? And, you know, trying to tell them that trying to tell them that everything will be okay when everything will be okay when truly they don\u2019t know whether truly they don\u2019t know whether everything will go okay. Why are everything will go okay. Why are people willing to risk mass people willing to risk mass deportation risk being put in deportation risk being put in detention centers, risk having detention centers, risk having their families separated? Why? their families separated? Why? Because for a lot of people, Because for a lot of people, this is the better life. I think this is the better life. I think the real danger here is that the real danger here is that immigration advocacy groups are immigration advocacy groups are telling people, don\u2019t cooperate, telling people, don\u2019t cooperate, don\u2019t come to the door, don\u2019t don\u2019t come to the door, don\u2019t don\u2019t stop your vehicle. You don\u2019t stop your vehicle. You know, all of these things that know, all of these things that could then lead to criminal could then lead to criminal prosecutions. But people do have prosecutions. But people do have the right to remain silent. They the right to remain silent. They do have the right not to open do have the right not to open their door. If there isn\u2019t a their door. If there isn\u2019t a warrant signed by a judge. warrant signed by a judge. Correct? Correct. And now the Correct? Correct. And now the difference is we are we are much difference is we are we are much it is a much easier process for it is a much easier process for us to obtain that warrant signed us to obtain that warrant signed by a judge.

You got a warrant for your arrest. A 47 year old for your arrest. A 47 year old man from Venezuela who they say man from Venezuela who they say has a history of drug and has a history of drug and weapons convictions. So weapons convictions. So eventually he did end up leaving eventually he did end up leaving his house. And we were able to his house. And we were able to apprehend him before he took apprehend him before he took off. His wife wouldn\u2019t open the off. His wife wouldn\u2019t open the door. We don\u2019t have any reason door. We don\u2019t have any reason to suspect the wife\u2019s here to suspect the wife\u2019s here illegally. But this has already illegally. But this has already been a busy day for ICE\u2019s been a busy day for ICE\u2019s enforcement and removal enforcement and removal operations team. Today we have operations team. Today we have three targets meeting up. Hours three targets meeting up.

Matthew Elliston, Maryland field office Elliston, Maryland field office director for U.S. Immigration director for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, says and Customs Enforcement, says their targets have all been their targets have all been ordered deported from an ordered deported from an immigration judge. They\u2019re using immigration judge. They\u2019re using what\u2019s called administrative what\u2019s called administrative warrants to make the arrest. warrants to make the arrest. None have current pending None have current pending criminal charges. So why the criminal charges. So why the early morning operations? You early morning operations? You know, most of our our targets know, most of our our targets work early in the morning, work early in the morning, arresting someone when they\u2019re arresting someone when they\u2019re half asleep at 5:00 in the half asleep at 5:00 in the morning is less. There\u2019s morning is less. There\u2019s statistically there\u2019s less statistically there\u2019s less likelihood that they are going likelihood that they are going to fight back. We know the to fight back. We know the targets that we\u2019re going after, targets that we\u2019re going after, right? We don\u2019t do dragnets. We right? We don\u2019t do dragnets. We don\u2019t go door to door. That\u2019s don\u2019t go door to door. That\u2019s never something that ISIS has never something that ISIS has done. But the difference from done. But the difference from previous administrations, his previous administrations, his team can also make what\u2019s called team can also make what\u2019s called collateral arrests. Undocumented collateral arrests. Undocumented immigrants they come across with immigrants they come across with no criminal charges. We\u2019re still no criminal charges. We\u2019re still targeting that worst of the targeting that worst of the worst person you know. Except worst person you know. Except now if we come across someone now if we come across someone who\u2019s standing next to him, who\u2019s standing next to him, who\u2019s also here illegally, we\u2019re who\u2019s also here illegally, we\u2019re going to take that person, too. going to take that person, too. That happened after agents That happened after agents waited for more than two hours waited for more than two hours near the home of a man from El near the home of a man from El Salvador. Ice says he\u2019s been Salvador. Ice says he\u2019s been convicted of DUI and negligent convicted of DUI and negligent manslaughter. The stakeout is manslaughter. The stakeout is something that could not have something that could not have been done last year, due to a been done last year, due to a 2011 policy that limited them, 2011 policy that limited them, targeting people near sensitive targeting people near sensitive locations such as schools or locations such as schools or churches. But that policy was churches. But that policy was rescinded in January by DHS. rescinded in January by DHS. This building behind us is a This building behind us is a Baptist church. You know, Baptist church. You know, despite us not doing anything at despite us not doing anything at the church like we wouldn\u2019t even the church like we wouldn\u2019t even be allowed to be parked in a be allowed to be parked in a parking lot, really, anywhere parking lot, really, anywhere within like a two block radius within like a two block radius of here. We wouldn\u2019t be allowed of here. We wouldn\u2019t be allowed to work. After pulling him over, to work. After pulling him over, they also detained his brother. they also detained his brother. A collateral arrest. We also A collateral arrest. We also know that his brother was prior. know that his brother was prior. Prior deport. So he\u2019s been Prior deport. So he\u2019s been removed from the United States removed from the United States previously. Look, my family, my previously. Look, my family, my kids. Understand? You got to go. kids. Understand? You got to go. This is a total change and an This is a total change and an escalation in how immigrants are escalation in how immigrants are being treated. Attorney Michael being treated. Attorney Michael Lukens is with Amica Center for Lukens is with Amica Center for Immigrant Rights. It works to Immigrant Rights. It works to help detainees know their help detainees know their rights. I think what really rights. I think what really concerns me is you don\u2019t look at concerns me is you don\u2019t look at someone who was born in the someone who was born in the United States who had a criminal United States who had a criminal background and say, well, they background and say, well, they are a criminal forever, right? are a criminal forever, right? You don\u2019t label them a criminal You don\u2019t label them a criminal and make them a second class and make them a second class citizen. Why is it okay to do citizen. Why is it okay to do that for an immigrant? Tensions that for an immigrant? Tensions are definitely much, much higher are definitely much, much higher among Frimpong with the among Frimpong with the immigrant advocacy group Casa immigrant advocacy group Casa says. There\u2019s a lot of fear says. There\u2019s a lot of fear right now, especially for right now, especially for families who might lose a parent families who might lose a parent or breadwinner to deportation. I or breadwinner to deportation. I see, you know, moms, right, who see, you know, moms, right, who are trying to console their are trying to console their kids, right? And, you know, kids, right? And, you know, trying to tell them that trying to tell them that everything will be okay when everything will be okay when truly they don\u2019t know whether truly they don\u2019t know whether everything will go okay. Why are everything will go okay. Why are people willing to risk mass people willing to risk mass deportation risk being put in deportation risk being put in detention centers, risk having detention centers, risk having their families separated? Why? their families separated? Why? Because for a lot of people, Because for a lot of people, this is the better life. I think this is the better life. I think the real danger here is that the real danger here is that immigration advocacy groups are immigration advocacy groups are telling people, don\u2019t cooperate, telling people, don\u2019t cooperate, don\u2019t come to the door, don\u2019t don\u2019t come to the door, don\u2019t don\u2019t stop your vehicle. You don\u2019t stop your vehicle. You know, all of these things that know, all of these things that could then lead to criminal could then lead to criminal prosecutions. But people do have prosecutions. But people do have the right to remain silent. They the right to remain silent. They do have the right not to open do have the right not to open their door. If there isn\u2019t a their door. If there isn\u2019t a warrant signed by a judge. warrant signed by a judge. Correct? Correct. And now the Correct? Correct. And now the difference is we are we are much difference is we are we are much it is a much easier process for it is a much easier process for us to obtain that warrant signed us to obtain that warrant signed by a judge. Ellis says he hears by a judge. Ellis says he hears the concerns about Ice, but says the concerns about Ice, but says his agents are just following his agents are just following the law. You know, during one of the law. You know, during one of the arrests, we watched a woman the arrests, we watched a woman in a car drive by cursing at his in a car drive by cursing at his team. What goes through your team. What goes through your mind when that happens? You mind when that happens? You know, it\u2019s really a lack of know, it\u2019s really a lack of education. The average person, education. The average person, no matter where you fall on the no matter where you fall on the political spectrum, if they political spectrum, if they would stop and say, hey, like, would stop and say, hey, like, who is this person? Like, why who is this person? Like, why did you guys arrest him? And I\u2019d did you guys arrest him? And I\u2019d say he just did 12 years in say he just did 12 years in prison for, you know, dealing prison for, you know, dealing narcotics here in Hagerstown. narcotics here in Hagerstown. And, you know, this is not a And, you know, this is not a political issue. This is a political issue. This is a public safety issue. The people public safety issue. The people of Maryland are safer today of Maryland are safer today because of what we did. Matt because of what we did. Matt Elliston told us he\u2019s constantly Elliston told us he\u2019s constantly fielding calls, questioning if fielding calls, questioning if Ice agents are at schools. But Ice agents are at schools. But he says that has not happened he says that has not happened here in Maryland. Okay, so here in Maryland. Okay, so Tracee have any of these arrests Tracee have any of these arrests turned violent? I know he talked turned violent?

Yeah, that\u2019s a real concern for Yeah, that\u2019s a real concern for them every day that they do this them every day that they do this work. Elliston says his agents work. Elliston says his agents are always monitoring who\u2019s are always monitoring who\u2019s around them when making arrests around them when making arrests in public. They keep an eye out in public. They keep an eye out for children especially. That\u2019s for children especially. That\u2019s why they try to make these why they try to make these arrests in those controlled arrests in those controlled locations, such as vehicles like locations, such as vehicles like you saw in the video. Elliston you saw in the video. Elliston says that they rarely chase says that they rarely chase someone unless they have a someone unless they have a current violent criminal warrant current violent criminal warrant against them.
