								<excerpt><![CDATA[A jury awarded $1.68 billion in damages to 40 women who accused writer and director James Toback of sexual abuse and other crimes over a span of 35 years.]]></excerpt>
								<description>
				<![CDATA[
<p>A New York jury on Wednesday awarded $1.68 billion in damages to 40 women <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/lawsuit-alleges-writer-director-james-toback-is-a-serial-sexual-predator/3984900/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who accused writer and director James Toback</a> of sexual abuse and other crimes over a span of 35 years, according to lawyers representing the plaintiffs.</p>



<p>The decision stems from a lawsuit filed in Manhattan in 2022 after New York state <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ghislaine-maxwell-prisons-new-york-lawsuits-donald-trump-cfa02ae176f77452f86a7a0072e557f8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">instituted a one-year window</a> for people to file lawsuits over sexual assault claims even if they took place decades ago.</p>



<p>It marks one of the largest jury awards since the advent of the #MeToo movement, as well as in New York state history, said attorney Brad Beckworth, of the law firm Nix Patterson LLP, in an interview. The plaintiffs, he said, believe such a large verdict will send a message to powerful individuals “who don&#8217;t treat women appropriately.”</p>



<p>The court had not yet released documentation of the verdict as of Wednesday night. Beckworth said the verdict included $280 million in compensatory damages and $1.4 billion for punitive damages to the plaintiffs.</p>



<p>“This verdict is about justice,” Beckworth said in a statement. “But more importantly, It’s about taking power back from the abusers — and their and enablers — and returning it to those he tried to control and silence.”</p>



<p>Beckworth said the abuse took place between 1979 and 2014.</p>



<p>Toback was nominated for an Oscar for writing 1991′s “Bugsy,” and his career in Hollywood has spanned more than 40 years. Accusations that he engaged in years of sexual abuse surfaced in late 2017 as the #MeToo movement gained attention. They were first reported by the Los Angeles Times.</p>



<p>In 2018, Los Angeles prosecutors said the statutes of limitations had expired in five cases they reviewed, and declined to bring criminal charges against Toback.</p>



<p>The plaintiffs then filed a lawsuit in New York a few days after the state&#8217;s Adult Survivors Act went into effect. The lawyers said they discovered a pattern of Toback attempting to lure young women on the streets of New York into meeting him by falsely promising roles in his films and then subjecting them to sexual acts, threats and psychological coercion.</p>



<p>Mary Monahan, a lead plaintiff in the case, called the jury award “validation” for her and the other women.</p>



<p>“For decades, I carried this trauma in silence, and today, a jury believed me. Believed us. That changes everything,” she said in a statement. “This verdict is more than a number — it’s a declaration. We are not disposable. We are not liars. We are not collateral damage in someone else’s power trip. The world knows now what we’ve always known: what he did was real.”</p>



<p>Toback, 80, who most recently had represented himself, denied numerous times in court documents that he “committed any sexual offense” and that “any sexual encounter or contact between Plaintiffs and Defendant was consensual.”</p>



<p>He also argued that New York&#8217;s law extending the statute of limitations on sexual abuse cases violated his constitutional rights.</p>



<p>A message sent to an email address listed for him seeking comment was not immediately answered.</p>



<p>In January, the judge in the case entered a default judgment against Toback, who had failed to appear in court when ordered to do so. The judge then scheduled a trial for only damages last month to determine how much Toback had to pay the women.</p>

				<![CDATA[


<div class="wp-block-nbc-localized-block">
<p>The wife of a Weezer band member was shot by police as officers searched for three people involved in a <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/police-shoot-at-armed-woman-after-hit-and-run-suspect-tries-to-hide-in-her-home/3673987/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/police-shoot-at-armed-woman-after-hit-and-run-suspect-tries-to-hide-in-her-home/3673987/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit-and-run crash</a> on a freeway in a residential Los Angeles neighborhood.</p>
</div>



<p>Jillian Shriner, wife of Weezer bassist Scott Shriner, was injured in the shooting, which unfolded during a neighborhood police search.</p>



<p>The chain of events began after authorities responded to a <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/police-shoot-at-armed-woman-after-hit-and-run-suspect-tries-to-hide-in-her-home/3673987/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/police-shoot-at-armed-woman-after-hit-and-run-suspect-tries-to-hide-in-her-home/3673987/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three-vehicle crash on the 134 Freeway</a> in Eagle Rock near Figueroa Street just after 3 p.m. in the San Gabriel Valley community east of Los Angeles. The California Highway Patrol said a driver and passengers abandoned the car following the crash and ran into a neighborhood near Eagle Vista Drive and Figueroa Street.</p>





<div class="wp-block-nbc-localized-block">
<p>One of the three men involved in the hit-and-run surrendered. NBC Los Angeles&#8217; NewsChopper 4 was over the scene during the arrest and captured a man in his boxers being taken into custody.</p>
</div>



<p>During the search for the other individuals, an armed woman came out of her home on Eagle Vista Drive. Police officers fired at the woman, identified Wednesday by the LAPD as Jillian Shriner, who was struck in the shoulder.</p>

<p>Shriner was arrested about an hour later and booked on suspicion of attempted murder. She allegedly pointed a handgun at officers and did not abide by police commands to drop the weapon, the LAPD said.</p>



<p>According to Det. Megan Aguilar, public information officer for the LAPD, the woman did not know the subjects of the search.</p>



<p>She was treated for non-life-threatening injuries.</p>



<p>The identities of those who were arrested have not been released. Details about whether the two other individuals sought by police were not immediately available. </p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>The Lay’s potato chip company is asking fans to decide on a future flavor for its lineup. The finalists for the “Do Us a Flavor” contest have been announced and this year’s competition comes with a $1 million reward.</p>



<p>The three final flavors &#8220;are hitting the shelves near you,&#8221; <a href="https://www.dousaflavor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lay&#8217;s contest website reads</a>. <a href="https://dousaflavor.com/dark" data-type="link" data-id="https://dousaflavor.com/dark" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Voting kicks off</a> on April 21 and runs through June 13.</p>



<p>During that time, chip snackers can visit local stores to taste and vote on the three finalist flavors, each created by snack lovers from across the country with the help of Lay&#8217;s experts.</p>



<p>The finalists are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Valentina &amp; Lime — a flavor made from Valentina hot sauce and lime juice</li>



<li>Korean-Style Fried Chicken — a spicy and sweet chip inspired by South Korean street food</li>



<li>Bacon Grilled Cheese — a chip inspired by the nostalgic sandwich recipe of the finalist&#8217;s father</li>
</ul>







<p>The flavor with the most votes at the end of the contest will be crowned the winner and the creator will walk away with the million-dollar grand prize. The two runners-up won’t leave empty-handed either, each earning $50,000.</p>



<p>While the chips are only available for a limited time, one lucky flavor may become a permanent part of the Lay’s lineup. As Lay&#8217;s put it: &#8220;The future of snacking is up to you!&#8221;</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>One Florida mom is asking the question every parent’s been dying to scream into the void: Why do children’s play spaces open so ridiculously late?</p>



<p>“Y’all, we have been up since 5:15,” Ronsina Ray — mother to a 4-year-old and a 2-year-old — began a recent TikTok video. “Can somebody please explain to me why the stuff for kids opens at 10 or 11 o’clock in the morning?”</p>



<p>“I’ve lived five different lives. I’ve cooked two meals. I’ve watched 16 hours of TV. I have showed my head, shoulders, knees and toes. I done labeled every body part. I done shapes, colors, letters,” Ray, 31, continued. “We done went to the potty three times. We’ve had four snacks. We went outside for an hour — and you’re still not open? &#8230; By the time y’all open, we done made it to high school graduation.”</p>



<p>During an interview with TODAY.com, Ray points out another issue: the hours clash with many nap schedules.</p>



<p>“By the time we get there, my kids, who’ve been awake since 5, are cranky and fighting and it&#8217;s time to leave,” Ray says.</p>



<p>Jokingly, she suggests creating her own “little space” for parents and children to gather first thing in the morning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.today.com/food/restaurants/whatever-happened-to-mcdonalds-playplaces-rcna195698" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I’m picturing the old McDonald’s with an indoor play area</a>,” she says. “I can drink some coffee, my kids can play and we can have some breakfast. Wouldn’t that be nice?”</p>



<p>If the comments on Ray’s TikTok are any indication, she may have the beginnings of a successful new business venture.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“10am is DINNER TIME,” one person wrote.</li>



<li>“The library opening at 10am is seriously criminal.”</li>



<li>“And then I take you at 10 but you fall asleep in the car for 5 minutes on the way home and ruin my whole goddamn day.”</li>



<li>“I have been asking this question since becoming a mom. I mean by the time they open, 1/2 my day is done!”</li>



<li>“Lowe’s opens at 7. Used to take the kids and let them explore the model kitchens and appliances.”</li>



<li>“Don’t have kids but one time I saw a LINE of parents and kids waiting at the door of the indoor playground at 9:58AM. They looked STRESSED.”</li>



<li>“At this point give me the keys and we can get it set up early and popping. My kids would be free employees in exchange for early fun.”</li>



<li>“We have a new play place that opens at 7am and I was like welp you get all my money.&#8221;</li>

				<![CDATA[
<p>What seemed like an April Fool&#8217;s prank at first glance became a successful marketing promotion as KFC&#8217;s fried chicken-flavored toothpaste and accompanying toothbrush have — you guessed it — sold out.</p>



<p>KFC announced the fried chicken dental concoction on April 1. While many assumed it was a joke, the house Colonel Sanders built was adamant the collaboration with <a href="https://hismileteeth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hismile</a> was no laughing matter.</p>



<p>&#8220;Not a prank. It’s here. And it’s Finger Lickin’ Good,&#8221; KFC wrote on Instagram.</p>







<p>Many commented on the post sharing disappointment — seemingly because they failed to read the caption or do some follow-up research.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m too tired. I thought this was real. How dare u kfc,&#8221; one Instagram user commented.</p>



<p>&#8220;Awh man I wish this was real 💔,&#8221; another user wrote.</p>



<p>KFC wanted to reassure its followers by replying: &#8220;It’s real we promise 🤞 visit the link in our caption 😊&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This toothpaste is like biting into a crispy, hot, juicy piece of KFC Original Recipe Chicken. Bring the unmistakable taste of crispy, golden perfection straight to your toothbrush for a full-on flavour takeover,&#8221; <a href="https://us.hismileteeth.com/pages/kfc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hismile&#8217;s website reads</a>.</p>



<p>But as the toothpaste that cost $13 and the separate toothbrush that cost $59 recently sold out, the disappointment will continue for many who wished to brush their teeth with the iconic flavor blend of 11 herbs and spices.</p>

<p>KFC is known for eye-catching marketing stunts. A Colonel Sanders look-alike <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/national-international/thats-col-sanders-not-khaddafy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breached United Nations security</a> in 2009, and met with former UN General Assembly President Ali Treki.</p>



<p>While the idea of fried chicken-flavored toothpaste may be good for laughs, the novelty paste doesn’t contain fluoride — an important naturally occurring mineral that helps <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/health/facts-community-fluoridation-reduce-tooth-decay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prevent cavities and strengthen enamel</a> for healthy teeth.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/tag/lebron-james" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LeBron James</a> is going from Crypto.com Arena to a &#8220;Mojo Dojo Casa House.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mattel, the makers of Barbie, announced on Wednesday that the <a href="http://nbclosangeles.com/tag/los-angeles-lakers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Los Angeles Lakers</a> superstar will be the first professional athlete to get his own Ken doll in his likeness.</p>



<p>James will become Mattel&#8217;s first &#8220;Kenbassador&#8221; in a collaboration with the <a href="https://www.lebronjamesfamilyfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LeBron James Family Foundation</a>, with the hopes of &#8220;inspiring and contributing to a better world for all&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;As a young kid, I was fortunate to have role models who not only inspired me but also showed me what’s possible through hard work and dedication,” James said in a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250409552793/en/Barbie-Debuts-LeBron-James-Doll-Marking-the-Brands-First-Kenbassador" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a>. &#8220;Now, as an adult, I understand how vital it is for young people to have positive figures to look up to. </p>



<p>&#8220;That’s why partnering with Barbie to release the LeBron James Kenbassadors doll is such an honor. It’s an opportunity to recognize the powerful impact of role models who instill confidence, inspire dreams, and show kids that they, too, can achieve greatness.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">When does the LeBron James Ken doll come out?</h2>



<p>The LeBron James Kenbassador doll hit shelves on Monday, April 14. Cost is $75 per doll.</p>



<p>In-store availability includes select Target locations, while online purchases can be made at Target, Amazon, Walmart and Mattel Creations.</p>



<p>Mattel will donate a copy of James&#8217; children&#8217;s book, &#8220;<a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/i-am-more-than-lebron-james?variant=41156841898018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I Am More Than</a>,&#8221; to Save the Children for every doll sold at Target and Target.com from April 14-19, up to 5,000 copies. </p>



<p>Additionally, Barbie is making a donation to the LeBron James Family Foundation to &#8220;help inspire the limitless potential of every child and invest more resources to create generational change for the kids and families of James’ hometown&#8221; of Akron, Ohio.</p>



<p>“For the LeBron James Family Foundation and the families we serve, this is so much more than a doll. It represents the reality that a kid from anywhere can make a difference,” said Michele Campbell, executive director of the LeBron James Family Foundation.&nbsp;“We are incredibly honored to partner with Barbie to continue inspiring the next generation and to celebrate LeBron’s unwavering commitment to his community by giving back through the LeBron James Kenbassadors doll.”</p>

<p>The dolls comes clad in a custom varsity jacket over the LeBron James Family Foundation’s signature &#8220;We Are Family&#8221; T-shirt, Nike Terminator High sneakers, Beats headphones, sunglasses, a fanny pack, a watch and his perennial &#8220;I Promise&#8221; band.</p>



<p>The doll not only captures James&#8217; style, but also his height. It will be one inch taller than the standard Ken doll and come in larger, custom packaging.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>It&#8217;s an early <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/tag/easter/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/tag/easter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Easter</a> for fans of donuts.</p>



<p>Krispy Kreme on Monday unveiled its newest assortment of Easter-themed donuts, featuring three new flavors and one fan favorite that is returning.</p>



<p>The first newcomer is a &#8220;Bunny Basket&#8221; donut, which is based on Krispy Kreme&#8217;s original glazed flavor, dipped in chocolate icing, decorated with chocolate flavored buttercream and topped with a confectionery bunny.</p>



<p>Next is the &#8220;Marshmallow&#8221; bunny donut. This is an unglazed donut, filled with marshmallow creme, dipped in pastel yellow icing and topped with a bunny face and confectionery ears.</p>



<div class="wp-block-nbc-html-block html-block"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hop into sweetness! 🐰 The Hoppy Easter Collection is here, featuring four festive flavors everybunny will love!<br><br>🧺 Bunny Basket Doughnut<br>🐣 Marshmallow Bunny Doughnut<br>🐰 Bouncing Bunny Doughnut<br>🍓 Strawberry Iced with Sprinkles <a href="https://t.co/MrEKV4YmCk">pic.twitter.com/MrEKV4YmCk</a></p>&mdash; Krispy Kreme (@krispykreme) <a href="https://twitter.com/krispykreme/status/1909350477004702143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 7, 2025</a></blockquote> </div>



<p>The last new flavor is the &#8220;Bouncing Bunny&#8221; donut. This is also original glazed, dipped in pastel blue icing and sprinkles and topped with a bouncing bunny.</p>



<p>Returning is the strawberry iced donut with sprinkles.</p>



<p>“We’re passing on the eggs this Easter and instead hopping into the holiday with all-new bunny-themed doughnuts that are almost too cute to eat. Almost!&#8221; Dave Skena, Krispy Kreme chief growth officer, said in a release. &#8220;And … you don’t have to hunt for these doughnuts; just hop to a Krispy Kreme shop near you.&#8221;</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>&#8220;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/duke-university-white-lotus-suicide-attempt-rcna198355" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The White Lotus</a>&#8221; creator Mike White did not hold back when asked about an alleged feud with composer Cristóbal Tapia de Veer, calling Tapia de Veer&#8217;s decision to speak to the media days before the show&#8217;s season finale &#8220;a b&#8212;- move.&#8221;</p>



<p>The actor and director dialed into &#8220;The Howard Stern Show&#8221; Tuesday where he was asked about what happened with Tapia de Veer. The composer publicly announced in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/style/white-lotus-composer-season-4-leaving.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an interview with the New York Times</a>&nbsp;that he would not be returning for a fourth season of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/maria-shriver-son-patrick-schwarzenegger-not-white-lotus-character-rcna199129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit HBO series</a>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and hinted at strife between him and White stemming back to the first season.</p>



<p>&#8220;I just don&#8217;t think he respected me. He, like, wants people to know that he&#8217;s edgy and dark and I&#8217;m, I don&#8217;t know, like, I watch reality TV,&#8221; White said to Stern.</p>



<p>Tapia de Veer, who won three Emmys for his work on the show, told the Times in the interview published Wednesday that he had creative disagreements and fights with White, adding that the creator initially wanted music that lacked edge for the first season&#8217;s theme.</p>



<p>&#8220;He had a temp score, a song that is more like something you would listen to in Ibiza, in some clubby place with a chill, sexy vibe,&#8221; Tapia de Veer told the outlet. &#8220;And there’s literally no edge to it. It’s a good song; it’s nice music. There’s just absolutely no — whatever you find in the &#8216;White Lotus&#8217; music, the relationships with the characters — there’s none of that. It’s just nice background music.&#8221;</p>



<p>When the show&#8217;s third season premiered on Feb. 16, social media exploded with audience members who noted the discontinuation of the theme song from the first two seasons, which was replaced by music that paid homage to Thailand, where the season was set.</p>

<p>Tapia de Veer wanted to humor the public&#8217;s longing for the familiar war cry melody by weaving it into a longer version of the Season 3 theme, but said White refused due to their fights, the Times reported. The composer uploaded&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-xTYfAjQEU&amp;t=157s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the longer version</a>&nbsp;to his YouTube last month.</p>



<p>White, on the other hand, said he never fought with the composer.</p>



<p>&#8220;We never really even fought, I don&#8217;t know what — he says we feuded, I don&#8217;t think I ever had a fight with him except maybe some emails,&#8221; White said on &#8220;The Howard Stern Show.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But it was just basically, like, me giving him notes, you know? Like I just don&#8217;t think he liked to have to go through the process of getting notes from me or wanting revisions or whatever,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>White said Tapia de Veer is not a team player &#8220;and wanted to do it his way,&#8221; adding that he was &#8220;thrown&#8221; that the composer spoke to the press &#8220;to s*** on&#8221; him and the show ahead of the finale.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was kind of a b&#8212;- move,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>White also said he felt the composer was making a big deal out of differences in opinion, but highlighted that he thinks Tapia de Veer is &#8220;very talented.&#8221;</p>



<p>Stern weighed in on the reported feud, telling White that Tapia de Veer should follow his vision for the music as he is the show&#8217;s creator.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why quit a smash hit show because you got some notes and some differences, just f&#8212;ing work it out,&#8221; Stern said about the composer.</p>

<p>After the radio show aired Tuesday, Tapia de Veer wrote on his&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/CristobalMusic/status/1909654820463522133" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">X account&nbsp;</a>that he&#8217;s &#8220;gonna have to tell the full story now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I did try to avoid it, dude&#8230;,&#8221; the composer wrote.</p>



<p>In an&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/CristobalMusic/status/1909698169266466930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update</a>&nbsp;on Tuesday afternoon, Tapia de Veer shared a screenshot of what appears to be an Instagram reel with the caption, &#8220;the white lotus composer QUIT because mike white made him cut the second half of this song and I will never forgive mike for as long as I live.&#8221;</p>



<p>The composer said he &#8220;learned a lot about how they work a BS campaign that builds towards an interview where the guy capitalizes on the lies they spread.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m glad I archive all texts and emails dude, they all have dates and stuff you know, those can be verified it’s not just talking&#8230; :),&#8221; he wrote on X.</p>

								<description>
				<![CDATA[
<p>The once-extinct dire wolf species, popularized in HBO&#8217;s &#8220;Game of Thrones,&#8221; has been brought back. But were <a href="https://colossal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Colossal Biosciences</a> scientists behind the de-extinction so preoccupied with whether or not they could, that they didn&#8217;t stop to think if they should?</p>



<p>The Dallas-based biotech company on Monday announced the large canines&nbsp;that went extinct nearly 13,000 years ago were <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/national-international/dire-wolves-back-to-life-colossal-biosciences-de-extinction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partly revived by breeding three wolf pups</a> that carry genes of their long-lost ancestors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" width="3657" height="2060" src="https://media.nbcwashington.com/2025/04/Dire-Wolves-e1744065470363.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all&#038;w=3657&#038;resize=3657%2C2060" alt="Dire wolves born by extinction" class="wp-image-10384959" srcset="https://media.nbcwashington.com/2025/04/Dire-Wolves-e1744065470363.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=3657&amp;strip=all 3657w, https://media.nbcwashington.com/2025/04/Dire-Wolves-e1744065470363.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://media.nbcwashington.com/2025/04/Dire-Wolves-e1744065470363.jpg?w=3000&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 3000w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Colossal Biosciences, a biotechnology company, announced the recent births of three dire wolves via its de-extinction process.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The de-extinction revelation generated curiosity, concern and commentary — including from a &#8220;Jurassic Park&#8221; social media account.</p>



<p>&#8220;We see no possible way this could go wrong,&#8221; the <a href="https://x.com/JurassicWorld/status/1909386233744330991" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;Jurassic World&#8221; account wrote on X</a>.</p>



<p>The tongue-in-cheek comment is a nod to the cautionary tale in Steven Spielberg&#8217;s 1993 classic film &#8220;Jurassic Park&#8221; in which the hubris of humanity&#8217;s science leads to destruction and chaos.</p>







<p>Seeing as Colossal Biosciences is also working to bring back the extinct prehistoric woolly mammoth and dodo species, it&#8217;s not unreasonable to imagine a world in which further developments in de-extinction lead to more &#8220;Jurassic Park&#8221; references.</p>



<p>However, the dire wolf comeback isn&#8217;t a full revival of the species. The DNA from the fossils of dire wolves was extracted and used to edit the genes of gray wolves. Those edited cells were used to create embryos that were transferred to surrogates, leading to an indirect rebirth of an extinct species.</p>



<p>The three pups, who were born six months ago, are named Romulus, Remus and Khaleesi. They feature traits of dire wolves — including a larger, stronger body and a longer, fuller coat with light pigmentation.</p>

<p>University at Buffalo biologist Vincent Lynch told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/scientists-genetically-engineer-wolves-white-hair-extinct-dire-wolf-rcna200139" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NBC News</a>&nbsp;the results only bring back the exterior semblance of an extinct species. Additionally, Lynch stresses this latest effort doesn’t mean dire wolves are coming back to North American grasslands any time soon.</p>



<p>“All you can do now is make something look superficially like something else”— not fully revive extinct species, he said.</p>



<p>Perhaps with more time and scientific breakthroughs, we&#8217;ll see the full return of a once-extinct species. As we know, life finds a way.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p><em>Originally appeared on <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1415733/eminems-daughter-hailie-jade-gives-baby-middle-name-marshall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">E! Online</a>.</em></p>



<p><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411365/inside-hailie-jades-road-to-baby-with-husband-evan-mcclintock" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hailie Jade</a> was not afraid to turn to her family for the perfect baby name.</p>



<p>So, when <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/eminem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eminem&#8217;s</a> daughter and her husband <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1364014/eminems-daughter-hailie-jade-is-engaged-to-evan-mcclintock" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evan McClintock</a> <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1408360/eminems-daughter-hailie-jade-gives-birth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">welcomed their son</a> on April 4, they took inspiration from the “Lose Yourself” rapper (real name Marshall Mathers) by naming him Elliot Marshall McClintock, with his middle name being a nod to his grandfather.</p>



<p>Eminem has been along for the ride as he prepared to become a first-time grandfather. In fact, Jade — whose mom is Kim Scott — <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1408159/eminem-shares-emotional-reaction-to-daughter-hailie-jades-pregnancy?query=Hailie%2520Jade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced her pregnancy</a> in her dad’s music video for “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaK9Wi5ho0o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Temporary</a>” featuring Skylar Gray, a track dedicated to his daughter.</p>



<p>The heartfelt video shows footage of her growing up and the love he has for his little girl. At the end of the video, Jade gifts him a <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1387387/eminem-and-hailie-jade-are-the-ultimate-father-daughter-team-at-nfl-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detroit Lions jersey</a> with “#1 Grandpa” on the back alongside a sonogram for her baby, leaving Eminem shocked. And the 29-year-old previously detailed what it was like to share that moment with him.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>YouTube baby whisperer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ms-rachel-bullying-fundraising-children-gaza-rcna152701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ms. Rachel</a>&nbsp;has welcomed her second child — a baby girl.</p>



<p>Rachel Griffin Accurso announced on Instagram that she and her husband, Aron, had welcomed a baby girl named Susannah via surrogate.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are so in love!&#8221; she wrote in a post on Tuesday. &#8220;Sometimes timing isn’t what you plan, and the road to get there is bumpier than you expect, but when you hold your little ones, you know… I’m meant to be your mama.&#8221;</p>



<p>She also shared a sweet photo of her cuddling her sleeping little one on a couch.</p>







<p>Accurso explained in the post that she was &#8220;unable to carry this pregnancy for medical reasons.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We were blessed&nbsp;to have a surrogate who gave us the most precious gift possible. We are now all family forever. We have immense gratitude and a deep bond. It’s been a truly beautiful experience. I’m in awe of her,&#8221; she continued.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She ended the post with a message of love to her husband: &#8220;Aron — Thank you for being the best husband and dada!&#8221;</p>



<p>Susannah is the couple&#8217;s second child. They also share a 7-year-old son named Thomas.</p>



<p>Last year, Accurso revealed her son was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/parents/moms/ms-rachel-rainbow-baby-miscarriage-rcna170238" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">born after a miscarriage</a>.&nbsp;She shared a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_sj6ScOWND/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=b3820f1f-3ce9-435a-9b33-9cedeacd6d0d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">touching post</a>&nbsp;singing a song with the lyrics &#8220;Rainbow baby dream come true.&#8221; The term &#8220;<a href="https://www.today.com/parents/rainbow-babies-pregnancy-after-loss-t173503" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rainbow baby</a>&#8221; refers to a baby who is born following a miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal death.</p>



<p>Accurso is known for making educational videos for babies and toddlers, singing songs, and helping them build language.</p>



<p>She and her husband created their YouTube channel after they said they couldn’t find the right resources to help with their son’s speech delay.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" style="margin-bottom: 0px" src="https://media.nbcwashington.com//image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/250408-ms-rachel-mn-1205-0500b4.jpg?w=900&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="Ms. Rachel on TODAY" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ms. Rachel on TODAY in 2024. (Nathan Congleton/NBC)</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;His first word was at 2 years and 8 months and it was ‘mama’ and I had waited for that for so long,&#8221; Accurso previously told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/video/viral-sensation-ms-rachel-takes-today-inside-her-channel-155971141726" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;TODAY</a>.&#8221; &#8220;As a parent, you want to do anything you can to help them, and it’s not our fault when our child has a speech delay. A lot of things I teach are things I wish I had known for my son.&#8221;</p>



<p>Accurso has taken a hiatus from the YouTube channel, with her last video posted in January. In March, she said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/parents/ms-rachel-youtube-absence-rcna197560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the break was due to family matters.</a></p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Clem Burke, whose versatile drumming propelled the iconic rock group Blondie during its decades performing everything from new-wave punk to disco-infused tunes, has died. He was 70.</p>



<p>The band <a href="https://www.blondie.net/news/clem-burke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in a statement on its website</a> Monday that he died from cancer, but no additional details were provided.</p>



<p>“Clem was not just a drummer; he was the heartbeat of Blondie,” the band said in a statement. “His talent, energy, and passion for music were unmatched, and his contributions to our sound and success are immeasurable.”</p>



<p>The self-proclaimed “rock &amp; roll survivalist” started playing the drums when he was 14 in his school orchestra but was kicked out for playing too loud, according to Blondie’s website. In the 1970s, he answered a band&#8217;s ad in the Village Voice seeking a “freak energy” rock drummer, kicking off his decades-long career with lead singer Debbie Harry and the rest of his Blondie bandmates.</p>



<p>The band recorded its first album in 1976 and by the following year was touring with such icons as Iggy Pop and David Bowie. It became known as the most commercially successful band to emerge from a fertile New York rock scene that also produced Talking Heads and the Ramones.</p>



<p>In 2006, Burke and the other original members of Blondie were inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame after selling more than 42 million records, according to Blondie&#8217;s website.</p>



<p>During the late 1970s and early ’80s, the band had eight Top 40 hits, including four No. 1s: “Heart of Glass,” “Call Me,” “The Tide Is High” and “Rapture,” which is regarded as the first No. 1 hit to feature rap. There’s also a five-track 1975 album demo that includes “Platinum Blonde,” a sort of band mission statement. But Burke’s mark was especially solidified with his rapid, powerful drumming at the start of “Dreaming” in 1979.</p>



<p>In 2022, after unearthing a New Wave treasure trove of reel-to-reel tapes, cassettes and records, the band created the box set&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-music-new-york-andy-warhol-1538c5e22683611932d6053e0e2a1024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Blondie: Against the Odds, 1974-1982,”</a>&nbsp;with 124 tracks and 36 previously unissued recordings, demos, outtakes and remixed versions of Blondie’s initial six studio albums.</p>



<p>Burke reflected on the discovery in an Associated Press article: “We never would have thought that we would still be here today. Looking back at our archives, it’s pretty amazing.”</p>



<p>The Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame described Burke in a post Monday <a href="https://x.com/rockhall/status/1909251859518259529" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the social platform X</a> as “a versatile and distinctive drummer who played exactly what each song required – and, when called for, let loose with blistering punk rock energy.”</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Morgan Wallen sparked strong reactions online last month when he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/morgan-wallen-walks-off-snl-kenan-thompson-rcna198960" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abruptly walked off the “Saturday Night Live” stage</a>&nbsp;at the end of an episode in which he served as musical guest.</p>



<p>However, according to Bowen Yang, the country singer’s viral exit <a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/bowen-yang-kenan-thompson-morgan-wallen-snl-stage-exit-rcna200005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was hardly a watercooler topic</a> the next day among the “SNL” cast.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is the God’s honest truth: Nothing happened, and so even after it happened, we all just showed up to work the next day because it’s like, you’ve just got to move on to the next thing,” the “SNL” star said while&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/bowen-yang-reacts-ego-nwodim-weekend-update-snl-rcna199994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-hosting TODAY with Jenna &amp; Friends</a>&nbsp;on April 7.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the March 29 episode of “SNL,” Wallen&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/morgan-wallen-walks-off-snl-controversy-rcna198766" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walked offstage abruptly as the credits rolled</a>, instead of following tradition and mingling with the cast members.</p>



<p>Kenan Thompson, who appeared as a guest on TODAY with Jenna &amp; Friends, also weighed in on the viral moment.</p>



<p>“I’m not familiar,” Thompson joked when Jenna Bush Hager asked him about Wallen&#8217;s exit.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you, Mikey Madison and <a href="https://twitter.com/MorganWallen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MorganWallen</a>! Goodnight! <a href="https://t.co/FDlInhhHqb">pic.twitter.com/FDlInhhHqb</a></p>&mdash; Saturday Night Live &#8211; SNL (@nbcsnl) <a href="https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/1906220126245880009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 30, 2025</a></blockquote> 



<p>Thompson agreed with Yang that it was time to leave the moment in the past.</p>



<p>“You’ve got to move on, you know what I mean?” he said. “And I wish we would give more props to (host) Mikey (Madison) because she had a great show, and I think we would like to echo that a little more.”</p>



<p>Madison, who recently won an Oscar for her starring role in “Anora,” made her “SNL” hosting debut the night Wallen appeared as the musical guest.</p>



<p>Thompson also shared his thoughts on Wallen’s abrupt exit in a recent interview with&nbsp;<a href="https://ew.com/kenan-thompson-reacts-morgan-wallen-walking-off-snl-stage-exclusive-11706140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t know what goes through people’s minds when they decide to do stuff like that. I don’t know if he understood the assignment or not, or if he was really feeling a certain kind of way,” he said.</p>



<p>“You see somebody before you get a chance to say hi or say good job or anything like that, they just dipping,” he also said. “I thought maybe he had to go to the potty or something.”</p>



<p>He added that Wallen’s unexpected departure was “a spike in the norm.”</p>

<p>“We’re so used to everybody just turning around and high-fiving us, everybody’s saying, ‘Good job, good job, good job.’ So when there’s a departure from that, it’s like, hmm, I wonder what that’s about?”</p>



<p>“SNL” poked fun at Wallen’s quick exit during this weekend&#8217;s episode.</p>



<p>During the “Weekend Update” segment on April 5, co-host Colin Jost&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/snl-reacts-morgan-wallen-walk-off-stage-rcna199895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped a reference</a>&nbsp;to Wallen while discussing the recent upheaval in the stock market.</p>



<p>“Just in the past two days, investors have lost over $6 trillion,” he said. “Money is leaving the stock market faster than Morgan Wallen at goodnights.”</p>



<p>Wallen’s appearance on “SNL” came after another&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/music/morgan-wallen-controversies-rcna170444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversy</a>&nbsp;involving the country star and the show several years ago.</p>



<p>He had been scheduled to appear as the musical guest in October 2020, but was pulled from the show’s lineup after videos surfaced of him partying without a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Wallen was later rebooked on the show and appeared as the musical guest that December.&nbsp;</p>

								<excerpt><![CDATA[A movie theater in New Jersey is not allowing unaccompanied children to see the most popular movie of the year after an “unacceptable” incident during a recent screening related to viral TikTok videos and a "chicken jockey."]]></excerpt>
								<description>
				<![CDATA[
<p>A movie theater in a New Jersey town is restricting children from seeing the most popular movie of the year after an &#8220;unacceptable&#8221; incident during a recent screening.</p>



<p>The Township Theater in Bergen County&#8217;s Washington Township announced Monday that children will not be admitted to any screenings for &#8220;A Minecraft Movie&#8221; without being accompanied by an adult.</p>



<p>&#8220;Any minors wishing to see The Minecraft Movie MUST be accompanied by a parent or responsible adult,&#8221; the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonTownshipTheatre" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">movie theater wrote on Facebook</a>. &#8220;Unaccompanied groups of boys will not be admitted.&#8221;</p>



<p>Theater officials said the decision was reached after a rowdy group of  unsupervised children, believed to be from nearby Waldwick, vandalized and otherwise disrupted a Sunday night showing of the Jack Black flick. Multiple other moviegoers who were there with families issued complaints about the group&#8217;s inappropriate behavior, according to the theater.</p>



<p>&#8220;They broke seats, they squirted lotion around, I don&#8217;t know why. They made a horrific mess,&#8221; said Dave Rose, who owns the theater with his wife, Laura. &#8220;We got a call from a mom complaining to us that her experience was very bad with her son.&#8221;</p>



<p>The theater also said it had obtained footage of the incident, and encouraged parents to talk to their children regarding the matter.</p>



<p>&#8220;Some of the kids who were at the theater that night posted on TikTok filming themselves being crazy,&#8221; said Laura Rose. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Why are kids in theaters going wild over a &#8216;Minecraft&#8217; scene? Blame TikTok</h2>



<p>So what is causing young people to act out and create disruptions amid &#8220;Minecraft&#8221; showings? It has a bit to do with TikTok and internet culture.</p>



<p>Much of the uproar centers around a particular scene featuring a baby zombie riding a chicken, known to Minecraft fans as a &#8220;chicken jockey.&#8221;</p>



<p>Videos posted on social media show audience members getting out of their seats, cheering, yelling, spilling drinks, throwing popcorn and other food around after Black&#8217;s character — Steve, the playable character in the video game — announces Jason Mamoa&#8217;s character will be facing off against one in what appears to be a boxing ring.</p>



<p>As Mamoa stands in the ring in the opposite corner of a chicken, a box appears above the cube-like bird. Falling from that box is a child zombie, which sits on the chicken and smiles before turning angry and charging at Mamoa. That&#8217;s when Black&#8217;s character simply says &#8220;chicken jockey&#8221; — which causes the young audience members to go wild, videos show.</p>



<p>Video from Seaford Cinemas on Long Island, courtesy of @salesmenpod, showed what some of the crowds have looked like — and then police coming in afterward to escort some of the moviegoers from the cinema:</p>



<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@salesmenpod/video/7489687576366943519" data-video-id="7489687576366943519" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@salesmenpod" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@salesmenpod?refer=embed" rel="noopener">@salesmenpod</a> This whole night was surreal and one of the most unforgettable movie experiences I’ve ever had. . . <a title="minecraft" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/minecraft?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#minecraft</a> <a title="movie" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/movie?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#movie</a> <a title="minecraftmovie" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/minecraftmovie?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#minecraftmovie</a> <a title="chicken" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/chicken?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#chicken</a> <a title="jockey" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/jockey?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#jockey</a> <a title="chickenjockey" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/chickenjockey?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#chickenjockey</a> <a title="fyp" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#fyp</a> <a title="viral" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/viral?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#viral</a> <a title="reaction" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/reaction?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#reaction</a> <a title="funny" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/funny?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#funny</a> <a title="meme" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/meme?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#meme</a> <a title="moviereview" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/moviereview?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#moviereview</a> <a title="featureme" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/featureme?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#featureme</a> <a title="clips" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/clips?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#clips</a> <a title="comedy" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/comedy?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#comedy</a> <a title="video" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/video?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#video</a> <a title="videogames" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/videogames?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#videogames</a> <a title="games" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/games?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#games</a> <a title="game" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/game?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#game</a> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Salesmen: After Hours" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7489687576073276190?refer=embed" rel="noopener">♬ original sound &#8211; Salesmen: After Hours</a> </section> </blockquote> 



<p>Part of why the scene has blown up so much boils down to internet/meme culture, with videos of such frenzied attendees going viral on TikTok, causing more people to want to go and do the same.</p>

I would go days without sleeping. It was wild. I felt like I was gonna give myself a heart attack. I was crushing it. I was snorting it. It was so problematic.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">The 39-year-old — who confirmed her relationship with &#8220;One Tree Hill&#8221; alum </span><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1413947/how-sophia-bush-is-supporting-partner-ashlyn-harris-new-career" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sophia Bush</a> <span style="font-weight:400">in April 2024 — continued of her college soccer career, “Then I was like, ‘Oh, it makes me skinny. It curbs my appetite.’ It was just a toxic, toxic time for me because it was the first time that I started to have my character tested because I started to get injured.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">But despite her addiction struggle while recovering from her multiple ACL and labrum injuries, Harris&#8217; college soccer coach </span>Anson Dorrance<span style="font-weight:400"> was there to support her. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400">“It got really, really dark and I had to make some serious adjustments,” she explained, “and Anson would have me read books. I started reading this book called [</span><span style="font-weight:400">Man’s Search</span><span style="font-weight:400">]</span><span style="font-weight:400"> for Meaning</span><span style="font-weight:400"> and it&#8217;s about suffering and reframing it and it changed my life.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">In the aftermath of her college experience, the two-time </span><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/world_cup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight:400">FIFA Women&#8217;s World Cup</span></a><span style="font-weight:400"> champ is now focused on using the hard-won lessons she learned to build a better future for </span><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1414017/ashlyn-harris-shares-update-on-co-parenting-2-kids-with-ex-ali-krieger" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight:400">her children</span></a><span style="font-weight:400">, </span>Sloane<span style="font-weight:400">, 4, and </span>Ocean<span style="font-weight:400">, 2, who she shares with ex-wife </span><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1410702/ali-krieger-slams-dishonesty-about-ashlyn-harris-split" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ali Krieger</a><span style="font-weight:400">. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">“I have a lot of trauma in my life and I have a lot of scars. I do not want to project and place that on my children,” Harris shared. “When you become a mom and you&#8217;re molding young humans, your perspective in life changes. You have to get your s&#8212; together because they see and hear everything.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">She added, “I just want to give my kids the best tools to be whoever they want to be. But at the core of them, they need to be good people. They have to be good people. How they serve their community, how they show up for their friends, that matters.”</span></p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Denis Arndt, a character actor and <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/tag/television/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorite of TV writer</a> and producer David E. Kelley, getting cast in “L.A. Law,” <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/tag/television/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Picket Fences”</a> and “Chicago Hope,” and later earning a Tony nomination for his Broadway debut at age 77 in a play about mismatched lovers, has died. He was 86.</p>



<p>Arndt died “peacefully in his bed” at his cabin home in Ashland, Oregon, his family announced in an obituary published March 26. It noted that he was born in 1939, the same year “The Wizard of Oz” came out. </p>



<p>“That was like Dad’s life,” it said. “It started out in black and white and blossomed into a life of color, brilliance, daring adventure and passion. And it was also a little bit trippy, like Oz.”</p>



<p>Arndt was a Vietnam veteran helicopter pilot who twice was awarded the Purple Heart and later flew helicopters in Alaska. He turned to acting after moving to Seattle, spending multiple seasons at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival and performing as an early member of the Intiman Theatre in Seattle. </p>



<p>His career began in the mid-1980s with roles on the TV shows “Crime Story” and “Wiseguy” and he would spend the 1990s in TV and film, with a highlight being one of the cops interrogating Sharon Stone’s character in Paul Verhoeven’s “Basic Instinct.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-nbc-html-block html-block"><p><iframe width="100%" height="350" frameborder="0" src="https://media.nbcnewyork.com/assets/editorial/national/2024/in-memoriam/index-sm.html"></iframe></p></div>



<p>Making his first and only Broadway appearance at age 77 opposite Mary-Louise Parker, Arndt received acclaim for his performance in “Heisenberg,” which debuted off-Broadway in 2015 before hitting Broadway a year later.</p>



<p>In the play by Simon Stephens, babble-mouthed 42-year-old Georgie from New Jersey randomly meets a bored 75-year-old Irish butcher, Alex, in a London train station and the two begin a strange courtship.</p>



<p>The Associated Press was charmed by the performers and Stephens&#8217; play: “He captures new love and old love at the same time, hope and fear, the new world and the old. He’s turned the simplest of tales — boy meets girl — into an unexpectedly rich thing with just two chairs, two tables and two actors.”</p>



<p>On TV, Arndt was a frequent Kelly collaborator, starting with “L.A. Law” and then as lawyer Franklin Dell on “Picket Fences” over four seasons. He also had roles on “Chicago Hope,” “Ally McBeal,” “The Practice,” “Boston Public,” “Boston Legal” and “Mr. Mercedes.”</p>



<p>His other small-screen credits include “Providence, ”The Wonder Years,&#8221; “Murder, She Wrote,” “Life Goes On,” “Herman’s Head,” “Touched by an Angel,” “Grey’s Anatomy” and “The Good Fight.” </p>



<p>He is survived by his wife, Magee, and his children, Scott, Tammy, Laurie, Kirsten, Bryce, McKenna and Tanner.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Winter is coming &#8230; and so are the dire wolves.</p>



<p>The large canines — best known for being featured in the HBO series &#8220;Game of Thrones&#8221; — went extinct nearly 13,000 years ago. But they&#8217;re now making a comeback.</p>



<p><a href="https://colossal.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://colossal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Colossal Biosciences</a>, a Dallas-based biotech company, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250407444322/en/Colossal-Announces-Worlds-First-De-Extinction-Birth-of-Dire-Wolves" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250407444322/en/Colossal-Announces-Worlds-First-De-Extinction-Birth-of-Dire-Wolves" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced Monday</a> it has revived the species by breeding three wolf pups that carry genes of their long-lost ancestors.</p>



<p>As part of a gene-editing restoration process the company calls de-extinction, the DNA from the fossils of dire wolves was extracted and used to edit the genes of gray wolves. Those edited cells were used to create embryos that were transferred to surrogates, leading to the rebirth of an extinct species.</p>



<p>The three pups, who were born six months ago, are named Romulus, Remus and Khaleesi. They feature traits of dire wolves &#8212; including a larger, stronger body and a longer, fuller coat with light pigmentation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" width="3657" height="2060" src="https://media.nbcwashington.com/2025/04/Dire-Wolves-e1744065470363.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all&#038;w=3657&#038;resize=3657%2C2060" alt="Dire wolves born by extinction" class="wp-image-10384959" srcset="https://media.nbcwashington.com/2025/04/Dire-Wolves-e1744065470363.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=3657&amp;strip=all 3657w, https://media.nbcwashington.com/2025/04/Dire-Wolves-e1744065470363.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://media.nbcwashington.com/2025/04/Dire-Wolves-e1744065470363.jpg?w=3000&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 3000w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Romulus and Remus at one-month-old.

<p>&#8220;This massive milestone is the first of many coming examples demonstrating that our end-to-end de-extinction technology stack works,” said Ben Lamm, the CEO of Colossal. “Our team took DNA from a 13,000-year-old tooth and a 72,000-year-old skull and made healthy dire wolf puppies.&#8221;</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t call it a comeback, some experts say. </p>



<p>University at Buffalo biologist Vincent Lynch told <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/scientists-genetically-engineer-wolves-white-hair-extinct-dire-wolf-rcna200139" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NBC News</a> the results only bring back the exterior semblance of an extinct species. Additionally, Lynch stresses this latest effort doesn’t mean dire wolves are coming back to North American grasslands any time soon.</p>



<p>“All you can do now is make something look superficially like something else”— not fully revive extinct species, he said. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">How was dire wolf DNA discovered?</h2>



<p>Colossal scientists learned about specific traits that dire wolves possessed by examining ancient DNA from fossils. </p>



<p>Researchers studied a 13,000 year-old dire wolf tooth unearthed in Ohio and a 72,000 year-old skull fragment found in Idaho — both part of natural history museum collections.</p>



<p>Beth Shapiro, Colossal’s chief scientist, says the scientists then took blood cells from a living gray wolf and used CRISPR to genetically modify them in 20 different sites. </p>



<p>They transferred that genetic material to an egg cell from a domestic dog, Shapiro said. When ready, embryos were transferred to surrogates, also domestic dogs, and 62 days later the genetically engineered pups were born.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Where do the dire wolf pups live?</h2>



<p>The pups live in an undisclosed 2,000-plus acre preserve in the northern United States that Colossal says is enclosed by a &#8220;10-foot-tall, zoo-grade fencing with redundant perimeter security.&#8221; Ten full-time animal care staffers tend to the wolves&#8217; well-being.</p>



<p>Colossal also announced that it birthed two litters of cloned red wolves, an endangered species, by using a new approach to non-invasive blood cloning. In March, the company revealed the birth of the woolly mouse &#8212; mice featuring mammoth-like traits engineered by gene modifications.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was once said, ‘any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,’” Lamm said. “Today, our team gets to unveil some of the magic they are working on and its broader impact on conservation.”</p>



<p>Colossal is calling the dire wolf the world’s first successfully de-extincted animal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The wolves were first brought back to life on screen in 2011 when &#8220;Game of Thrones&#8221; was adapted from George R.R. Martin&#8217;s fantasy novel series &#8220;A Song of Ice and Fire.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Bill Murray said a masked kiss in 2022 on the set of a movie led to sexual misconduct allegations that eventually shut down the film, an incident the famed actor says still bothers him and feels he was “barbecued” for.</p>



<p>In 2022, a female staff member working on the film set for “<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/bill-murray-speaks-accusations-inappropriate-behavior-led-suspension-m-rcna26784" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Being Mortal</a>” accused the &#8220;Ghostbusters&#8221; and &#8220;Groundhog Day&#8221; star of behaving inappropriately with her. The film, directed by Aziz Ansari, was eventually shelved by Searchlight Pictures.</p>



<p>“I don’t go too many days or weeks without thinking of what happened in ‘Being Mortal,’” the 74-year-old actor told The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/magazine/bill-murray-interview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Times</a>&nbsp;in an interview published Saturday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He explained that he had known the woman who made the complaint, and the incident involved him kissing her as they were both wearing face masks that were part of Covid-19 protocols.</p>



<p>Murray and the woman eventually reached a settlement, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/bill-murray-being-mortal-allegations-settlement-1236360953/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a> reported. The woman was never identified by anyone affiliated with the movie and has not come forward to comment on the matter.</p>



<p>When asked to discuss what unfolded, Murray said, &#8220;I tried to make peace. I thought I was trying to make peace. I ended up being, to my mind, barbecued.&#8221;</p>



<p>“But someone that I worked with, that I had had lunch with on various days of the week — it was Covid, we were all wearing masks, and we were all stranded in this one room listening to this crazy scene. I dunno what prompted me to do it. It’s something that I had done to someone else before, and I thought it was funny, and every time it happened, it&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;funny,&#8221; Murray said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was wearing a mask, and I gave her a kiss, and she was wearing a mask,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;It wasn’t like I&nbsp;<em>touched</em>&nbsp;her, but it was just, I gave her a kiss through a mask. And she wasn’t a stranger.&#8221;</p>



<p>He said the incident still “bothers me.”</p>



<p>&#8220;Because that movie was stopped by the human rights or &#8216;H &amp; R&#8217; of the Disney corporation, which is probably a little bit more strident than some other countries’. It turned out there were pre-existing conditions and all this kind of stuff. I’m like, what? How was anyone supposed to know anything like that? There was no conversation, there was nothing. There was no peacemaking, nothing,&#8221; Murray said.</p>



<p>&#8220;It went to this lunatic arbitration, which, if anyone ever suggests you go to arbitration: Don’t do it. Never ever do it. Because you think it’s justice, and it isn’t,&#8221; he continued.</p>



<p>The veteran comedian and critically acclaimed actor, who&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/bill-murray-no-stranger-bad-behavior-movie-sets-rcna25621" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has a long history of alleged bad behavior on movie sets</a>, said he thinks the whole experience was &#8220;stupid.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;You can teach an old dog new tricks. But it was a great disappointment, because I thought I knew someone, and I did not. I certainly thought it was light. I thought it was funny,&#8221; he said. &#8220;To me it’s still funny, the idea that you could give someone a kiss with a mask on. It’s still stupid. It’s all it was.&#8221;</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Where will the characters of &#8220;The White Lotus&#8221; check into next?&nbsp;</p>



<p>After an explosive&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/white-lotus-season-3-ending-explained-rcna199534" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 3 finale</a>&nbsp;on April 6, the show&#8217;s writer, director and creator Mike White teased where the fourth season will be set — or at least, where it&nbsp;<em>won’t</em>&nbsp;be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For the fourth season, I want to get a little bit out of the ‘crashing waves against rocks’ vernacular,” he said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDnS_lOBD5w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview</a>&nbsp;at the end of the Season 3 finale.</p>



<p>The first three seasons of the hit drama took place at fictional luxury seaside resorts in real locations: the first season was set in Maui, Hawaii; the second season in Sicily, Italy; and the latest season at an idyllic beach resort in Thailand.</p>



<p>But even if the next season of “White Lotus” unfolds somewhere more inland, it sounds like the show will continue to serve up the same wicked cocktail of privilege, sex and death.</p>



<p>“There’s always room for more murders at the White Lotus hotels,” White said with a laugh.</p>



<p>Production for Season 4 will likely begin in 2026,&nbsp;<a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-white-lotus-renewed-season-4-1236282444/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>&nbsp;reported in January.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s unknown whether any previous cast members will appear in the new season, as a few have done in previous seasons. Jennifer Coolidge (Tanya McQuoid), Natasha Rothwell (Belina Lindsey) and Jon Gries (Greg Hunt) have all appeared in more than one season.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fans can expect that the next season’s opening theme music will likely have a different feel. Cristóbal Tapia de Veer, the composer who created the opening songs of all three seasons, recently confirmed to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/style/white-lotus-composer-season-4-leaving.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Times</a>&nbsp;that he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/music/white-lotus-composer-season-4-leaving-rcna199538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not be returning for another season</a>, citing creative differences with White.</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time White has teased an upcoming season of “The White Lotus.&#8221; When Season 2 ended, he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5bJhYPr5k0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hinted at</a>&nbsp;the direction the show would take for Season 3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The first season kind of highlighted money, and then the second season is sex, and I think the third season, it would be maybe a kind of satirical and funny look at death and Eastern religion and spirituality,” he previously shared&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5bJhYPr5k0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview</a>&nbsp;that aired at the end of Season 2.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Tennis pioneer Billie Jean King added another first to her list of accomplishments Monday when her star was unveiled on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. </p>



<p>King, a groundbreaking sports figure and graduate of Long Beach Poly High School,  became the first woman to receive a star in the sports entertainment category.</p>



<p>King was honored for her work as an executive producer of the 2023 Public Broadcasting Service documentary series, &#8220;Groundbreakers&#8221; — which paired King and other such legendary female athletes as Basketball Hall of Famer Nancy Lieberman, two-time Women&#8217;s World Cup champion and two-time Olympic gold medalist Julie Foudy and track and field world record holder Jackie Joyner-Kersee — with current stars four-time tennis singles Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka, two-time Olympic gold medal-winning snowboarder Chloe Kim and two-time Olympic gymnastics gold medalist Sunisa Lee, Ana Martinez, the Hollywood Walk of Fame&#8217;s producer, told City News Service.</p>



<p>King&#8217;s other entertainment credits include being an executive producer of &#8220;The Battle of the Sexes,&#8221; a 2013 documentary on her 1973 match against Bobby Riggs; portraying a judge on a 2007 episode of the long-running NBC crime and legal drama, &#8220;Law &amp; Order&#8221;; and portraying herself on episodes of such series as &#8220;Fresh Off the Boat,&#8221; &#8220;Arli$$&#8221; and a 1973 episode of &#8220;The Odd Couple&#8221; that featured Riggs.</p>



<p>Basketball Hall of Famer Earvin Magic Johnson, a fellow member of the Dodgers&#8217; ownership group with King, and Oscar-winning actress Jamie Lee Curtis, a longtime friend of King&#8217;s, joined her in speaking at the ceremony at 6284 Hollywood Blvd., adjacent to the W Hotel.</p>



<p>&#8220;What I love about BJK is she uses her platform to bring about change,&#8221; Johnson said.</p>



<p>The star is the 2,807th since the completion of the Walk of Fame in 1961 with the initial 1,558 stars.</p>







<p>King is a pioneer in the women&#8217;s rights and gender-equality movements. In 1970, she was part of the &#8220;Original Nine&#8221; women&#8217;s professional tennis players who broke away from the governing bodies of tennis to form their own professional tour, the Virginia Slims Circuit, which later evolved into the modern Women&#8217;s Tennis Association Tour.</p>



<p>King was also among the founders of World Team Tennis, the first co-ed professional sports league. She is a member of the Professional Women&#8217;s Hockey League Founding Advisory Board. The league&#8217;s Most Valuable Player award is named for her.</p>



<p>King won 39 Grand Slam titles &#8212; 12 in singles competition, 16 in women&#8217;s doubles and 11 in mixed doubles. In 1971, King became the first woman athlete to earn $100,000 in a year.</p>

<p>King was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1987. In 1990, Life magazine named her one of the &#8220;100 Most Important Americans of the 20th Century.&#8221;</p>



<p>The category was announced in 2021 by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which administers the Walk of Fame. It honors individuals, not teams or sports affiliated groups, who have made significant contributions to the world of entertainment and demonstrated &#8220;longevity of excellence&#8221; in their sport, according to Ana Martinez, the Hollywood Walk of Fame&#8217;s producer.</p>



<p>New York Giants Hall of Fame defensive end turned &#8220;Good Morning America&#8221; anchor Michael Strahan was the first recipient in the category in 2023. The second recipient was the late Carl Weathers, honored for a nearly 50-year acting career best remembered for his portrayal of Sylvester Stallone&#8217;s boxing nemesis-turned-friend and mentor Apollo Creed in the first four &#8220;Rocky&#8221; movies.</p>



<p>Weathers, also a Long Beach Poly High School grad, played linebacker for San Diego State, the Oakland Raiders and Canadian Football League&#8217;s BC Lions before his acting career.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/adam_devine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Devine</a> <span style="font-weight:400">had a typical adolescent experience go horribly awry.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">The &#8220;Modern Family&#8221; star, who recently shared that he is <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1415678/adam-devines-details-lasting-injuries-from-cement-truck-accident" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">still dealing with health problems</a> after getting hit by a cement truck as an 11-year-old, detailed how his first time pleasuring himself ended with him losing a toe.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">“I&#8217;m in the bathtub and I couldn&#8217;t stand because of my accident, and I just found masturbation, and oh, did I love it,” Devine explained during an April 2 episode of &#8220;</span><a href="https://youtu.be/GJaXY8irElc?t=157" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight:400">In Depth with Graham Bensinger</span></a><span style="font-weight:400">.&#8221; “This was one of the first times I had masturbated and it’s a pretty epic event when you figure it out, you’re like, ‘I can do this all the time?’&#8221;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">But Devine shared that his big moment was quickly interrupted by an effect of his accident.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400">“So I’m in the bathtub and I couldn’t stand because of my accident—I’m cranking down,” he explained. “It was the first time something had come out. And I’m like, ‘What is this?’ And as I’m trying to get it to dissipate, I see a little toe — my pinky toe, just floating in the bathtub.”</span></p>



<p><em><b>READ</b>: <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1415678/adam-devines-details-lasting-injuries-from-cement-truck-accident" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adam Devine Says Doctors Told Him He Was Dying Due to Childhood Accident</a></em></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">And while doctors told Devine, now 41, that his toe was likely to fall off due to his accident, he joked, “I’m thinking I jerked off so hard my toe fell off.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">Naturally, when his mom, </span>Penny Devine <span style="font-weight:400"> —who Devine explained was a huge help when it came to his recovery — came in to help, he began shouting, “Don’t touch the water!”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">Later in the same episode, the &#8220;Workaholics&#8221; actor shared that he is still dealing with symptoms from the accident. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">“It’s been a nightmare,” Devine admitted. “I have spasms all over. For a while, [the doctors] told me I was dying—literally, within this last year.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">Indeed, Devine&#8217;s medical team thought he may have developed <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1403877/why-celine-dion-waited-to-share-her-stiff-person-syndrome-diagnosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stiff Person Syndrome</a>, but ultimately discovered his muscles are still vulnerable after his accident as a kid. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">“My body has all these things that are a little wonky and a little wrong with it,” he shared, “that I just sort of snapped.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">After several rounds of stem cells, <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam is on his road to recovery</a>—but clearly not without a few NSFW hiccups on the way.</span></p>

				<![CDATA[
<p><em>Originally appeared on <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1415730/white-lotus-season-3-deaths-murders-revealed">E! Online</a>.</em></p>



<p><p style="font-weight:400"><em><strong>Warning: </strong>This article contains major spoilers for the April 6 finale of &#8220;The White Lotus.&#8221;</em></p></p>



<p><p style="font-weight:400">Multiple guests have checked out of <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/the_white_lotus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;The White Lotus&#8221;</a> — permanently.</p></p>



<p><p style="font-weight:400"><span style="font-weight:400">Indeed, during the heartbreaking <a href="https://www.eonline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">season 3 finale</a>,</span> Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood) and Rick (Walton Goggins) were the guests whose vacation ended in tragedy.</p></p>



<p><p style="font-weight:400">While Rick had seemingly found peace, his happiness was disrupted when the man he thought killed his father, Jim Hollinger (Scott Glenn), returned to the White Lotus. And when Rick shoots him in a fit of rage — only for Sritila (Lek Patravadi) to tell him Jim was Rick&#8217;s father all along — Rick and Chelsea are both killed in the subsequent shootout. </p></p>



<p><p style="font-weight:400">It was a heartbreaking, yet epic, 90-minute conclusion the season that maybe shouldn’t have come as a surprise. After all, actress Charlotte Le Bon (who played Chloe) <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/white-lotus-finale-mike-white-interview-1236177751/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">warned The Hollywood Reporter</a> ahead of the finale, “People are going to hate <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1415685/white-lotus-composer-quits-over-mike-white-feud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike White</a>.”</p></p>



<p><p style="font-weight:400">And indeed, the creator and writer knew his finale may bring about mixed reactions.</p></p>



<p><p style="font-weight:400">“My hope is that it’ll feel like a cathartic sad or a satisfying sad and not a ‘What the f&#8212;?’ sad,” he added to THR in the interview published April 2. “But people are going to have a million different opinions. You just hope you stick the landing.”</p></p>

<p><p style="font-weight:400">For the <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/survivor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;Survivor&#8221;</a> alum, even bringing to life the feature-length finale episode was a labor of love.</p></p>



<p><p style="font-weight:400">“As a filmmaker,” he added, “it’s probably the piece of work that I’m like, ‘I can’t believe I did that.’”</p></p>



<p><p style="font-weight:400">But while fans were on the edge of their seats heading into the April 6 finale to see how everything unfolded, as it turns out, some of the cast was, too.</p></p>



<p><p style="font-weight:400"><a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/1415051/white-lotus-michelle-monaghan-reveals-surprising-part-of-being-parker-poseys-roommate?query=arker%2520posey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parker Posey</a>, who played Victoria Ratliff, confessed to THR, “I forgot who died. It was so stressful when I read it. The dark stuff, I blazed through.”</p></p>



<p><p style="font-weight:400">Plus, some cast and crew members were specifically left in the dark as to prevent spoilers — including <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/patrick_schwarzenegger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patrick Schwarzenegger</a>, whose portrayal of Saxon Ratliff caused quite a stir throughout the season.</p></p>



<p><p style="font-weight:400">“I’m just excited to watch the finale with the rest of the world,” he admitted, “because I actually have no idea what happens.”</p></p>



<p><p style="font-weight:400">As producer David Bernad explained, “This season, our script supervisor wrote these crazy fake endings that we distributed on set. We didn’t distribute the real last script. People on set didn’t know.”</p></p>



<p><p style="font-weight:400">Which means, some cast and crew also didn’t know about the fates of other beloved characters, whose fates were wrapped up in the finale.</p></p>

<p><p style="font-weight:400">For the Ratliff family, tragedy almost strikes when Lochlan unwittingly serves himself a poisoned smoothie, however, he revives in his father&#8217;s arms, and the Southern family returns home — their lives about to be forever changed due to Timothy&#8217;s misdeeds. </p></p>



<p><p style="font-weight:400">The three friends — Laurie, Jaclyn and Kate — ultimately forgive each other&#8217;s jabs and leave the White Lotus closer than before, while Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) leaves $5 million richer after she strikes a deal with Gary/Greg (Jon Gries) to keep silent over the mysterious circumstances of his wife&#8217;s death. </p></p>



<p><p style="font-weight:400">But no matter how fans feel about saying goodbye to Rick and Chelsea, no one feels more bittersweet about their check out from the White Lotus than White.</p></p>



<p><p style="font-weight:400">“To be honest, I’m a bit of a head case right now,” the &#8220;School of Rock&#8221; alum admitted, telling THR he was crying in his car thinking about it. “This show is my whole life, then it’s over and I’m back in my house with my dog, trying to remember who my friends are and what did I do before the show.<span style="font-size: 1.0625rem">”</span></p></p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Jay North, who starred as the towheaded mischief maker on TV&#8217;s “Dennis the Menace” for four seasons starting in 1959, has died. He was 73. </p>



<p>North died Sunday at his home in Lake Butler, Florida, after battling colon cancer, said Laurie Jacobson, a longtime friend, and Bonnie Vent, who was his booking agent.</p>



<p>“He had a heart as big as a mountain, loved his friends deeply. He called us frequently and ended every conversation with ‘I love you with all my heart,’” Jacobson wrote in a tribute on Facebook. </p>



<p>North was 6 when he was cast as the smiling troublemaker in the CBS sitcom adaptation of Hank Ketcham&#8217;s popular comic strip that took place in an idyllic American suburb. </p>



<p>Often wearing a striped shirt and overalls, Dennis&#8217; mischievous antics frequently frustrated his retired next-door neighbor George Wilson, played by Joseph Kearns. Dennis&#8217; patient parents were played by Herbert Anderson and Gloria Henry. </p>



<p>The show ran on Sunday nights until it was canceled in 1963. After that it was a fixture for decades in syndication. </p>



<p>Later, North appeared on TV in shows including “The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,” “The Lucy Show,” “My Three Sons,” “Lassie” and “The Simpsons,” and in movies like “Maya” (1966), “The Teacher” (1974) and “Dickie Robert: Former Child Star” (2003).</p>



<p>North is survived by his third wife, Cindy, and three stepdaughters.</p>

<p><em>Originally appeared on <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1415764/comedian-jeff-ross-suffers-allergic-reaction-to-ice-cream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">E! Online</a></em></p>



<p>Jeff Ross is recovering after being rushed to the hospital to treat his first-ever allergic reaction.</p>



<p>The comedian, also known as the Roastmaster General, shared his negative experience with an ice cream treat on social media, along with a photo of the aftermath — a swollen lip.</p>



<p>&#8220;ROAST ME. TONIGHT&#8217;S SHOW NEAR SAN FRANCISCO MUST GO ON!&#8221; the 59-year-old wrote on his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIHCYTmpmtp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> April 6. &#8220;Had such a fun opening night performance of @takeabananafortheride up here in Mill Valley, California @throckmortontheatre. Afterwards, me and the band celebrated with some Burata ice cream at a restaurant down the street courtesy of the nice owner.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ross — who performed on many of <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/comedy_central" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comedy Central&#8217;s</a> <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/641425/all-of-justin-bieber-s-most-painful-reactions-at-his-roast-ranked" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrity roasts</a> and on <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1401609/tom-brady-admits-netflix-roast-jokes-affected-his-kids" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix&#8217;s 2024 &#8220;The Roast of Tom Brady</a>&#8221; — continued, &#8220;It was delicious. Seriously yummy. But my lips blew up and I spent the entire night in the ER. It was my first allergic reaction ever. I guess that’s pretty remarkable considering I’m constantly shoving whatever food is in front of me into my face.&#8221;</p>



<p><b>READ</b><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1316200/watch-john-mayer-and-jeff-ross-touching-tribute-to-bob-saget-after-picking-up-his-car-at-lax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Watch John Mayer and Jeff Ross&#8217; Touching Tribute to Bob Saget After Picking Up His Car at LAX</a></p>



<p>The comic thanked those working the overnight shift at MarinHealth Medical Center for &#8220;only roasting&#8221; him &#8220;lightly,&#8221; adding, &#8220;DESPITE LOOKING LIKE MICKEY ROURKE at the end of The Wrestler… I WILL BE TAKING A NAP AND BACK ON STAGE HERE IN MILL VALLEY NEAR SAN FRANCISCO AT 730pm TONIGHT.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ross, who is performing his new one-man show Take a Banana for the Ride, had his photo reposted on the Throckmorton Theatre&#8217;s Instagram Stories, along with the quip, &#8220;Don&#8217;t mind how @therealjeffreyross looks, it&#8217;s worse than it is.&#8221;</p>







<p>Ross&#8217; reaction to the ice cream comes follows a different health crisis. Last year, the comedian revealed at his comedy shows he had been diagnosed with cancer. He said his treatment has been successful, but declined to elaborate, the <a href="https://www.startribune.com/insult-king-jeff-ross-probably-will-cry-during-his-five-night-run-in-minneapolis/601231811" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minnesota Star Tribune</a> reported this past March.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want the show to be maudlin, but I think it’s important to address it,&#8221; he told the newspaper about talking about his diagnosis on stage. &#8220;I don’t want people to feel sorry for me. It’s going to be a very empowering and bold statement on how to get through tough times.&#8221;</p>



<p>On the Netflix special &#8220;Torching 2024: A Roast of the Year,&#8221; which Ross hosted, his friend <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/john_stamos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Stamos</a> noted the comedian was in recovery and remission.</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t lose anymore funny people,&#8221; the Full House alum — whose costar <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1315737/bob-saget-dead-at-65" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bob Saget, a mutual friend, died in 2022</a> — said to Ross, after kissing him on the cheek. &#8220;The world can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>They didn&#8217;t forget about us either, Chicago. </p>



<p>For the first time ever, the five core cast members of the popular 1985 John Hughes movie &#8220;The Breakfast Club&#8221; are set to reunite in Chicago &#8212; and the day is almost here.</p>



<p>Ally Sheedy, Anthony Michael Hall, Emilio Estèvez, Judd Nelson and Molly Ringwald are all listed on the <a href="https://www.c2e2.com/en-us/guests.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guests page</a> of <a href="https://www.c2e2.com/en-us/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C2E2</a>, Chicago Comic &amp; Entertainment Expo, beginning Friday and running through Sunday at McCormick Place.</p>



<p>&#8220;First time for everything,&#8221; Estèvez wrote on Instagram this week. &#8220;A reunion 40 years in the making. See you soon, Chicago.&#8221;</p>



<p>C2E2 says this will be &#8220;the first and only time ever&#8221; the full main cast will reunite in Chicago.</p>



<p>&#8220;Welcome to C2E2, Emilio Estèvez!&#8221; the convention wrote on Instagram. &#8220;For the first and only time ever, the full main cast of The Breakfast Club is reuniting in Chicago this April to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the film. Emilio (all days) joins Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy (Sat-Sun), Anthony Michael Hall and Judd Nelson (now all days!). Don’t miss this exciting and rare opportunity.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The Breakfast Club&#8221; celebrated its 40th anniversary this year, in February.</p>



<p>Sheedy, Hall, Nelson and Ringwald, who play Allison Reynolds, Brian Johnson, John Bender and Claire Standish, respectively, in &#8220;The Breakfast Club&#8221; have made appearances together at comic-con and fan expos in the past. The inclusion of Estèvez, who played Andrew Clark, makes the occasion a rare and exciting reunion of the full crew.</p>

<p>And what better place than Chicago? &#8220;The Breakfast Club&#8221; was filmed in the Chicago suburb of Des Plaines at the former Maine North High School, which also made a cameo in Hughes&#8217; &#8220;Ferris Bueller&#8217;s Day Off.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A brain, a beauty, a jock, a rebel and a recluse,&#8221; C2E2 wrote on Instagram. &#8220;Before the day was over, they broke the rules. Meet the full cast for exclusive Autographs and Photo Ops, backdropped with the iconic red lockers, on sale now.&#8221;</p>



<p>C2E2&#8217;s website shows a schedule of autographing sessions for Sheedy, Hall, Nelson and Ringwald, with autographs ranging from $60-$70 and photo ops from $80-$90. A similar schedule for Estèvez isn&#8217;t listed, but his inclusion on the guests page notes he&#8217;ll be there all three days in the &#8220;autographing area.&#8221;</p>



<p>A look at the autographing sessions shows Hall will also be in attendance all weekend, while Sheedy, Nelson and Ringwald are expected to be at McCormick Place Saturday and Sunday. </p>



<p>According to the posted schedules four of them will sign autographs beginning at 12:40 p.m. CT until about 2:30 p.m. CT on Saturday and again at about 4:40 p.m. CT that day. Their schedules align again on Sunday, with sessions beginning around 12:30 p.m. CT and 2:50 p.m. CT.</p>

<p>British&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fka-twigs-cancels-tour-dates-north-america-visa-issues-rcna198221" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">singer FKA Twigs canceled her appearance at Coachella</a>&nbsp;in California later this week as the performer continues to face visa issues for her North American tour.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FKA Twigs, whose legal name is Tahliah Barnett, said Sunday that she was devastated to tell fans she&#8217;d be pulling out of the famed music festival. She was set to perform on Friday, the night Lady Gaga will be headlining the main stage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;It pains me to say this because i am so excited to bring you a creation that i have poured my soul into and i believe is amongst my strongest work and i know this news impacts so many of you that have already made plans and spent money in order to see these shows,&#8221; she said on her social media.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The singer said she was going to have to reschedule all of her North American commitments for April. This would have also included a performance at Axe Ceremonia festival in Mexico City, but the&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/AXECeremonia/status/1908912979568959817/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">festival’s Sunday date was canceled</a>.</p>







<p>The update comes after FKA Twigs had to cancel last week&#8217;s performances in Chicago, New York, and Toronto. She said at the time she was informed her production team &#8220;did not fill out the correct paperwork in a timely manner for us to have our visas to come to the USA and perform.&#8221;</p>



<p>She&#8217;s traveling across the United Kingdom and Europe for her latest album, &#8220;Eusexua,&#8221; which was released in January.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In her post Sunday, FKA Twigs described this tour as being amongst her strongest work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I promise that i am working to reschedule the affected dates as quickly as possible,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;for headline shows, please refer to your point of purchase for details and refund information.&#8221;</p>

								<excerpt><![CDATA[Going into the weekend, analysts projected “Minecraft” might hit $80 million. Instead, it nearly doubled that figure.]]></excerpt>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Hollywood needed “<a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/tag/movies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Minecraft Movie</a>” to be a hit, and it delivered in its opening weekend, significantly narrowing this year&#8217;s box office deficit.</p>



<p>No one guessed just how big it would be. In its first few days in theaters, the movie earned a staggering $157 million in ticket sales from theaters in the U.S. and Canada, according to studio estimates Sunday. Internationally, it’s looking at an additional $144 million for a global debut of $301 million. And with school spring breaks ongoing, “A Minecraft Movie” is just getting started.</p>



<p>Not only is it the biggest opening of 2025, “A Minecraft Movie” also broke the record for a <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/tag/video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video game adaptation</a>, a distinction previously held by “The Super Mario Bros. Movie&#8221; ($146 million). Going into the weekend, analysts projected “Minecraft” might hit $80 million. Instead, it nearly doubled that figure.</p>



<p>Nothing is guaranteed in the movie business, but an offering based on the best-selling video game of all time makes for a good start. It hardly mattered that the block-based game doesn’t exactly have a narrative. Many of its 200 million active monthly players turned out in droves anyway. </p>

<p>The PG-rated movie, directed by Jared Hess (“Napoleon Dynamite”), was a co-production of Legendary Entertainment and Warner Bros. It cost a reported $150 million to make, not including marketing and promotion expenses. Jack Black and Jason Momoa lead the ensemble cast (Danielle Brooks, Emma Myers and Sebastian Eugene Hansen). Their characters are transported into an imaginative dimension called the Overworld and need to go on a dangerous, and immensely silly, adventure to get home.</p>



<p>Critics were largely mixed on “A Minecraft Movie,” but audiences gave it a more promising B+ CinemaScore and 4/5 stars in PostTrak exit polls. Men made up around 62% of the audience, and 64% were under the age of 25. Warner Bros. went big on its release, opening the film in 4,263 locations domestically and 36,000 screens internationally.</p>



<p>“Younger audiences love going to the movie theater, believe it or not,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. “We thought this was an audience who would migrate to the small screens, but this is the perfect small screen to big screen alliance. It became a must-see theatrical event. Awareness was off the charts.”</p>



<p>Video game adaptations have had some pivotal successes in recent years, including “The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” the “Sonic” series and “Five Nights at Freddy’s.”</p>



<p>“Video games were once a genre that had very mixed results at the box office, but the code has finally been cracked,” Dergarabedian said.</p>



<p>Second place at this week&#8217;s box office went to the Jason Statham action pic “A Working Man,&#8221; which added $7.3 million in its second weekend. Third place was occupied by the second installment in the episodic “The Chosen: Last Supper” series. Part two (made up of episodes three through five) earned $6.7 million over the weekend. The third and final batch of episodes arrive in theaters on April 11. </p>



<p>“Snow White” slid to fourth place in its third weekend, bringing in $6.1 million. It&#8217;s now made over $168 million globally.</p>



<p>It’s been a difficult start to 2025 for Hollywood and movie theaters, with disappointments including “Snow White” and “Mickey 17.” But one hit can change the tides significantly, especially with in-theater marketing pushes in full swing for the pivotal summer movie season, which kicks off the first weekend in May. </p>



<p>Before this weekend, the box office was running at a 13% deficit compared with last year. Now the gap is down to 5%. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/tag/saturday-night-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;Saturday Night Live&#8221;</a> learned what happens when you offer up the mic to a live audience.</p>



<p>The sketch show retroactively censored a moment from the April 5, Jack Black-hosted episode when cast member Ego Nwodim joined Weekend Update&#8217;s Michael Che and Colin Jost to riff on the White House Correspondents&#8217; dinner. </p>



<p>NBC&#8217;s own <a href="https://apnews.com/article/amber-ruffin-white-house-correspondents-dinner-5c92401a3732d45213be365643f347fc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amber Ruffin was fired last week</a> as the host of this year&#8217;s dinner after she referred to the Trump administration as &#8220;kind of a bunch of murderers&#8221; on a podcast. The WHCA president said the group would refocus the dinner and would not hire any comedian to replace Ruffin.</p>



<p>During the Weekend Update segment, Nwodim took the microphone to perform her own roast of the dinner. But instead of going after politicians and journalists, as is typical of the event&#8217;s host, Nowdim made jokes about the actual dinner. </p>



<p>&#8220;They talking about they serving me some seared Alaskan Halibut. So I said, &#8216;halibut&#8217; you throw that mess in the trash,&#8221; she joked. </p>



<p>Near the end of her set, which devolved into a roast of men in general, Nwodim took a brief moment to turn the microphone to the Studio 8H audience. </p>



<div class="wp-block-nbc-html-block html-block"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ego Nwodim shows us what her White House Correspondents’ dinner routine would have been <a href="https://t.co/uGqixG739W">pic.twitter.com/uGqixG739W</a></p>&mdash; Saturday Night Live &#8211; SNL (@nbcsnl) <a href="https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/1908751002154451258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 6, 2025</a></blockquote> </div>



<p>&#8220;These men ain’t what?” she asked. And the audience answered. </p>



<p>In an uncensored clip from the episode, several members of the audience can be heard yelling back &#8220;s&#8212;!&#8221; and taking Nwodim, Che and Jost by surprise.</p>



<p>&#8220;We finna get fired for that,&#8221; Nwodim jokes, while Che and Jost double over in laughter behind her. &#8220;Lorne gonna be mad at y&#8217;all.&#8221;</p>



<p>The show wasn&#8217;t able to stop the word from going out on the broadcast during the live episode, but a censored version has since been circulated by the &#8220;SNL&#8221; social media pages and on the re-run episode playing on Peacock. </p>



<p>S&#8212; is one of what&#8217;s known as the FCC&#8217;s &#8220;seven dirty words,&#8221; which if used on broadcast television can earn a fine from the commission.</p>

<p>One week after singer Morgan Wallen drew controversy after <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/snl-musical-guest-morgan-wallen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walking off the &#8220;SNL&#8221; stage early</a> during the end credits, the show did not ignore what had taken place.</p>



<p>During the <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/trump-tariff-target-snl-cold-open/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">show&#8217;s cold open</a>, cast member James Austin Johnson, who was playing <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/tag/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">President Donald Trump</a> as he announced his sweeping tariffs at the White House, referred to the viral controversy.</p>



<p>Johnson as Trump began riffing about the Herd Island and McDonald Islands, which <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/politics/president-trump/trump-trade-war-penguin-tariffs-islands-antarctica/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are uninhabited islands</a> the president put tariffs on in real life.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ooo, McDonald Island, I&#8217;d love to visit there,&#8221; Johnson as Trump said. &#8220;Can you imagine that? A Big Mac in a hula skirt. Ooo la la.&#8221;</p>



<p>Johnson as Trump then held up artwork depicting the scenario and then said, &#8220;get me to God&#8217;s country, right?&#8221; The comment alluded to Wallen&#8217;s Instagram post hours after his time on the show last week, where he wrote the same words along with a picture of him on an airport tarmac.</p>







<p>The comment was <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/new-york-trolls-morgan-wallen-snl-exit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trolled by many New Yorkers</a>, with even the Empire State Building responding to the controversy.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">get me to god&#039;s country <a href="https://t.co/CavpiuXfGE">pic.twitter.com/CavpiuXfGE</a></p>&mdash; Empire State Building (@EmpireStateBldg) <a href="https://twitter.com/EmpireStateBldg/status/1906766294344429773?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 31, 2025</a></blockquote> 



<p>Wallen was also the butt of another joke during the show&#8217;s &#8220;Weekend Update,&#8221; when co-host Colin Jost compared the &#8220;Lies Lies Lies&#8221; singer to money leaving the stock market.</p>



<p>&#8220;Just in the past two days, investors have lost more than $6 trillion,&#8221; Jost said of the stock market slide this week. &#8220;Money is leaving the stock market faster than Morgan Wallen at good nights.&#8221; </p>







<p>Cast member Kenan Thompson <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/kenan-thompson-on-morgan-wallens-abrupt-snl-exit-seems-like-a-complicated-individual/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had responded to Wallen&#8217;s actions</a> earlier in the week in an interview with Entertainment Weekly March 31, saying, “I thought maybe he had to go to the potty or something.&#8221;</p>



<p>“It’s definitely a spike in the norm. We’re so used to everybody just turning around and high-fiving us, everybody’s saying, ‘Good job, good job, good job,'&#8221; Thompson added. So when there’s a departure from that, it’s like, ‘Hmm, I wonder what that’s about?’”</p>



<p>For his part, Wallen did not respond to the controversy directly but did <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/morgan-wallen-now-selling-merchandise-abrupt-snl-exit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">begin selling merchandise</a> with the phrase “Get me to God’s country&#8221; on his official website.</p>



<p>The host for the April 5 episode of &#8220;Saturday Night Live&#8221; was Jack Black, along with musical guests Brandi Carlile and Elton John.</p>



<p>The &#8220;School of Rock&#8221; star broke out in song during his monologue, doing his own rendition of Aerosmith&#8217;s &#8220;Back in the Saddle.&#8221; Take a look:</p>

<p>A rough week on Wall Street did not go unnoticed across town at 30 Rock on <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/tag/saturday-night-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;Saturday Night Live&#8221;</a> this weekend, with the show giving an &#8220;encore presentation&#8221; of <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/tag/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">President Donald Trump</a>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/politics/president-trump/trump-trade-war-penguin-tariffs-islands-antarctica/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of sweeping tariffs this past week. </a></p>



<p>&#8220;You know, some people say my plan is nonsense, but we&#8217;re using a formula,&#8221; James Austin Johnson as Trump said as he held up the same chart the real Trump did in his announcement. </p>



<p>After explaining his formula, which included a reference to the Chinese President Xi Jinping and the symbol for &#8220;sideways boobs,&#8221; Johnson as Trump assured people of their concerns. </p>



<p>&#8220;Anyway, your money is gone and we&#8217;re going to figure it out,&#8221; he said. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/tag/barack-obama" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Barack Obama</a> is sharing rare insight into his marriage with <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/tag/michelle-obama" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michelle Obama</a>.</p>



<p>The former U.S. president says he has been spending more time doing fun things with his wife after his two back-to-back terms in the <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/tag/white-house" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">White House</a>, which ended in 2017.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was in a deep deficit with my wife,&#8221; the Democratic leader told Hamilton College President Steven Tepper at an April 3 <a href="https://barackobama.medium.com/conversation-at-hamilton-college-0c44228ac0bd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">event</a> that was part of the school&#8217;s Sacerdote Series, &#8220;so I have been trying to dig myself out of that hole by doing occasionally fun things.&#8221;</p>



<p>The former president went on to talk about his life at home with Michelle Obama and their children, <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1407009/malia-obama-makes-rare-red-carpet-appearance-in-france" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Malia Obama</a>, 26, and Sasha Obama, 23, while discussing times he has not been able to communicate as effectively as he wanted to.</p>



<p>&#8220;First of all, I constantly lose arguments to my wife, my daughters,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They mock me and ridicule me at the dinner table.&#8221;</p>

Don&#8217;t start looking for your glasses, you know, at the three o&#8217;clock departure.&#8221;</p>



<p>Michelle Obama also shared a cheeky tidbit about her love of bedtime.</p>

								<excerpt><![CDATA[Tom Hanks and late ex-wife Susan Dillingham's daughter E.A. Hanks alleged she suffered emotional and physical violence from her mother in her new memoir The 10.]]></excerpt>
								<description>
				<![CDATA[
<p><em>Originally appeared on <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1415742/tom-hanks-susan-dillinghams-daughter-talks-childhood" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">E! Online</a></em></p>



<p><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/tom_hanks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Hanks</a>&#8216; only daughter is sharing rare insight into her childhood.</p>



<p>E.A. Hanks (short for Elizabeth Anne Hanks) accused her late mother — the Oscar winner&#8217;s ex-wife Susan Dillingham, who went by the stage name Samantha Lewes — of abuse following the couple’s divorce in the ‘80s.</p>



<p>According to the 42-year-old, the mistreatment allegedly started after Dillingham obtained primary custody of her and brother <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/colin_hanks">Colin Hanks</a>, now 47, and abruptly moved them from Los Angeles to Sacramento, Calif. She said the relocation caught Tom Hanks by surprise.</p>



<p>“My dad came to pick us up from school and we&#8217;re not there,&#8221; E.A. Hanks wrote in an excerpt from her book &#8220;The 10: A Memoir of Family and the Open Road,&#8221; published by <a href="https://people.com/ea-hanks-childhood-book-excerpt-exclusive-11707582" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>. &#8220;And it turns out we haven&#8217;t been there for two weeks and he has to track us down.&#8221;</p>



<p>“Eventually a divorce agreement was settled, and I would visit my dad and stepmother (and soon enough my younger half brothers) on the weekends and during summers,” she continued, referring to Tom Hank&#8217;s wife <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/rita_wilson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rita Wilson</a> and their sons Chet Hanks, 34, and Truman Hanks, 29, &#8220;but from 5 to 14, years filled with confusion, violence, deprivation, and love, I was a Sacramento girl.&#8221;</p>



<p><b>READ</b><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1392977/tom-hanks-and-rita-wilsons-rare-night-out-with-sons-truman-and-chet-is-sweet-like-a-box-of-chocolates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson&#8217;s Rare Night Out With Sons Truman and Chet Is Sweet Like a Box of Chocolates</a></p>



<p>And what began as a “white house with columns, a backyard with a pool, and a bedroom with pictures of horses plastered on every wall” eventually turned to a home that “stank of smoke,” according to E.A.</p>



<p>&#8220;As the years went on, the backyard became so full of dog s&#8211;t that you couldn’t walk around it,&#8221; she recalled. &#8220;The fridge was bare or full of expired food more often than not, and my mother spent more and more time in her big four-poster bed, poring over the Bible. One night, her emotional violence became physical violence.&#8221;</p>

<p>E.A. Hanks said she lived with her mom until the middle of seventh grade, when her custody arrangement reversed and allowed her to move to Los Angeles while visiting Sacramento over weekends and summers. During her senior year of high school, E.A. Hanks wrote that Dillingham had called her to say she was dying.</p>



<p>Dillingham died at age 49 in 2002 after battling bone cancer.</p>



<p>Tom Hanks has rarely spoken about his divorce. In a 2020 interview, he described it as a &#8220;horribly painful time&#8221; and talked about the breakup&#8217;s impact on himself, E.A. and Colin Hanks.</p>



<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t be a worse father and I couldn&#8217;t be a worse human being,&#8221; the &#8220;Saving Private Ryan&#8221; star said on &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFw34jMjQzI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In Depth with Graham Bensinger</a>.&#8221; &#8220;I think the job as a parent, one of the things I&#8217;ve learned, is to try to guarantee a carefree life for your children for as long as possible. They should not be burdened with the cares of the world until they can handle them.&#8221;</p>



<p>E! News has reached out to Tom Hanks&#8217; rep and has not received comment about E.A. Hanks&#8217; memoir.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Federal prosecutors on Friday added two charges to <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/tag/Sean-&quot;Diddy&quot;-combs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sean “Diddy” Combs</a>&#8216; indictment and said they expect four accusers to testify against him, expanding on allegations that the jailed hip-hop mogul engaged in sex trafficking <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/national-international/prosecutors-add-two-more-victims-to-sean-diddy-combs-federal-indictment/6129556/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with multiple women</a> and as recently as last year.</p>



<p>A superseding indictment accuses Combs of using force, fraud, or coercion to compel a woman to engage in commercial sex acts from at least 2021 to 2024.</p>



<p>The indictment, returned by a federal grand jury in Manhattan, also alleges Combs was involved in transporting the woman — identified only as “Victim-2” — and other people, including commercial sex workers, to engage in prostitution during the same time frame.</p>



<p>The new charges are in addition to racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges filed against Combs <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/p-diddy-arrest-abuse-charges-timeline/5803096/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when he was arrested in September</a>. They increase the total number of charges against him from three to five.</p>



<p>In a court filing, federal prosecutors said the racketeering conspiracy charge involves allegations that Combs sex trafficked three victims and forced a fourth, one of his employees, into sexual activity with him.</p>



<p>In the filing, which was heavily redacted, prosecutors said three of the four accusers who are expected to testify have asked that their identities not be revealed to the press or the public and that they instead be referred to by at trial using only pseudonyms.</p>



<p>The accuser referred to as &#8220;Victim-1&#8221; in Combs&#8217; charging documents is prepared to testify under her own name, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>Combs, 55, is scheduled to stand trial May 5. He remains locked up at a federal jail in Brooklyn. A message seeking comment on the new charges was left with his representatives.</p>



<p>Friday’s superseding indictment is the third filed against Combs.</p>



<p>In the first, <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/national-international/prosecutors-add-two-more-victims-to-sean-diddy-combs-federal-indictment/6129556/?os=iosno_journeys&amp;ref=app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed in January</a>, federal prosecutors disclosed that their case involved at least three women whom they said Combs forced to engage in commercial sex acts. They also alleged Combs showed a firearm to a female victim during a kidnapping and once <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/sean-diddy-combs-dangled-victim-over-balcony-prosecutors-say/6130552/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dangled a woman over an apartment balcony</a>.</p>



<p>Combs&#8217; January indictment didn&#8217;t include additional charges but modified some details of the existing ones, including adding four years to the alleged racketeering conspiracy. Prosecutors now say it started in 2004, not 2008 as the original indictment had alleged. A superseding indictment in March contained minimal changes.</p>



<p>Combs denies committing any crimes and <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/sean-diddy-combs-pleads-not-guilty-ahead-of-may-trial/6187711/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has pleaded not guilty</a> to the first set of charges, which allege that he coerced and abused women for years with help from a network of associates and employees while silencing victims through blackmail and violence, including kidnapping, arson and physical beatings.</p>



<p>His arraignment on the new charges has not been scheduled. Prosecutors asked Friday that it be held at his final pretrial conference on April 25.</p>



<p>Federal prosecutors allege the “I’ll Be Missing You” singer and Bad Boy Records founder used his “power and prestige” as a music star to induce female victims into drugged-up, elaborately produced sexual performances with male sex workers in events dubbed “Freak Offs.”</p>

<p>Central to the case is a March 2016 video showing Combs hitting and kicking his then-girlfriend, R&amp;B singer Cassie, in a Los Angeles hotel hallway. Prosecutors contend the assault happened during a “Freak Off.&#8221; Combs lawyers argue the footage was nothing more than a &#8220;glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship” between the two.</p>



<p>Combs&#8217; lawyers contend the case should never have been brought and are fighting to dismiss a charge involving allegations he transported a male escort across state lines.</p>



<p>“The government has concocted a criminal case based primarily on allegations that Mr. Combs and two of his longtime girlfriends sometimes brought a third party — a male escort — into their sexual relationship,” Combs lawyer Alexandra A.E. Shapiro wrote in a February court filing.</p>



<p>“Each of the three charges in the case are premised on the theory that this type of sexual activity is a federal crime,” Shapiro added.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard for <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/reese_witherspoon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reese Witherspoon</a> to keep the upcoming &#8220;Legally Blonde&#8221; prequel series completely under wraps.</p>



<p>The original Elle Woods confirmed filming is underway on the upcoming prequel series &#8220;Elle,&#8221; which will follow the titular character through high school, by sharing a sneak peek of star Lexi Minetree on set.</p>



<p>&#8220;Harvard was hard. High School was harder. Our new series, Elle, is now in production!&#8221; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DH9FBilvYS5/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Witherspoon, who is producing the new Prime Video show, shared on her Instagram</a> April 2. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t be more excited to introduce you all to @leximinetree as Elle Woods.&#8221;</p>







<p>Back in February, Witherspoon announced that Minetree, who was found in a global casting call, would take on the leading role <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGBVuezuxl7/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with a sweet video</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Allow me to introduce you to the new Elle Woods! After watching so many incredible auditions for the new Elle prequel series on @PrimeVideo, we finally found our Elle,&#8221; she wrote in the caption. &#8220;And today, I got to break the news myself! Meet @leximinetree.&#8221;</p>

<p>As to how Minetree reacted to the news? In her own post <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGBYVZxgEvL/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sharing the video of her casting announcement</a>, she wrote, &#8220;Ok ok ok, my brain is going nuts over here I don’t even know where to BEGIN.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you to my family, friends, and reps who believe in me and my silly lil dreams,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;Thank you to @amazonmgmstudios, @hellosunshine and everyone involved with this project for trusting me with this iconic role.&#8221;</p>



<p>She finished out her message by thanking the original Elle Woods herself.</p>



<p>&#8220;And thank you, thank you, THANK YOU to @reesewitherspoon for handing me down Elle Woods,&#8221; Lexi gushed. &#8220;I already love her so so much, I promise she’s in good hands. P.S. thank you for showing me how amazing I am going to look in the future, soooo looking forward to that:)&#8221;</p>



<p>And Witherspoon isn’t just revisiting the iconic role through &#8220;Elle.&#8221; The actress will return in &#8220;Legally Blonde 3,&#8221; which is being written by pal Mindy Kaling and Dan Goor.</p>



<p>Kaling, who <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/mindy-kaling-netflix-running-point-legally-blonde-3-1236311163/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared she and Goor turned in their most recent draft</a> of the film, previously shared insight into some of the big questions the film would explore.</p>



<p><p style="font-weight:400">&#8220;What is Elle Woods like at 42? Does she end up becoming all the things she wanted?” the &#8220;Running Point&#8221; creator posited to <a href="https://time.com/6160907/legally-blonde-3-mindy-kaling-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time</a> in 2022. “How does that personality manifest in a grown woman? Has she become more cynical? Her brightness and her cheerfulness really worked when she was 22, but how has life changed her perspective on things?&#8221;</p></p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>It looks like the second time may not be the charm for Fyre Festival.</p>



<p>The location that was said to be the site of next month’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/fyre-festival-2-dates-location-tickets-rcna193328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fyre Festival 2</a>&nbsp;may not serve as the venue, leading to questions about where the event will be held.</p>



<p>Fyre Festival founder Billy McFarland, who announced last September&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/news/news/fyre-festival-2-date-location-billy-mcfarland-rcna170141" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plans for a sequel for the festival</a>, said last week at a press conference that the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fyre.mx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new event</a>&nbsp;would take place in Playa del Carmen, Mexico.</p>



<p>In an April 3 post on X, however, city hall in Playa del Carmen said on X that it&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/GobPDC/status/1907645015184081296" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not play host</a>&nbsp;for the festival.</p>



<p>“&#8230; No such event with that name will take place in our city,” it wrote.</p>



<p>“There is no existence of a registry nor plans that would indicate such an event taking place in this municipality,” it added.</p>



<p>The comments came after McFarland spoke glowingly of the area during a recent press conference.</p>



<p>“Our relationships with Playa may be new, but I know I speak for the rest of the team when I say we couldn’t ask for a better group of people,” he said.</p>



<p>“We are very happy to have this festival in Mexico, in Playa del Carmen.&nbsp;We already have permits, so this is going to be very successful,” entrepreneur and Playa del Carmen’s Martina Beach Club founder Fernando Delgado said at the press conference.</p>



<p>This confusion over where Fyre Festival 2 — which has not announced any artists who will be performing — follows the disastrous first Fyre Festival in 2017. The location was moved four months before the start date, and while customers were initially promised a luxury experience, they were served cheese sandwiches and put up in emergency relief tents instead.</p>



<p>McFarland wound up serving four years in prison for <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fyre-festival-organizer-billy-mcfarland-sentenced-6-years-fraud-charges-n919086" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fraud</a> for that event. Still, he has remained committed to putting on another Fyre Festival, with tickets ranging in price from $1,400 to more than $1 million.</p>



<p>“I think Fyre 2 really isn’t about the past, and it’s not really about me. It’s about taking the vision, which is strong,” he told TODAY in an interview that aired in February.</p>



<p>McFarland also knows people may be taking a chance in buying a ticket.</p>



<p>“I think it’s always a risk,” he said. “You’re taking a risk because I made a lot of bad decisions and messed up the first festival. Until it’s experienced, there is a risk component to it.”</p>

								<excerpt><![CDATA[“Trevor got more game these ‘grown’ men out there… be a Trevor.”]]></excerpt>
								<description>
				<![CDATA[
<p>A Tennessee mom has a real gem of a story.</p>



<p>In a now-viral TikTok video, Allie Phillips shared that when her daughter Adalie was 6, she had a boyfriend who was the same age.</p>



<p>“She loves Brandon, they’re getting married,” Phillips, 30, explained.</p>



<p>Then one afternoon, Adalie came home from school with a token of love, and — plot twist! — it wasn’t from Brandon.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Before revealing the gift, Adalie encouraged her mom to “sit down.” Then, she announced that another first grader — a boy named Trevor — had given her a ring and asked her to be his girlfriend. Adalie happily said yes, leaving Brandon in the dust.</p>



<p>“I’m thinking it’s a Ring Pop or a plastic ring from a vending machine,” Phillips tells TODAY.com.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nope — it was a real diamond. And it was sized for an adult.</p>



<p>“So, of course, I was like, ‘Where did he get that ring?’” Phillips said in the TikTok clip, to which Adalie replied, “Oh, he says he buys them all the time.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>At that point, alarms were going off in Phillips’s head, so she quickly typed up a post on the school’s Facebook page. She shared all the juicy details about the love triangle, including how Adalie had dumped Brandon for Trevor.</p>



<p>“The comments did not disappoint,” Phillips said with a laugh.</p>



<p>“Trevor got more game these ‘grown’ men out there… be a Trevor ya’ll,” one parent wrote.</p>



<p>Added another, “But… who he buying rings ‘all the time’ for? Little man sounds like a player.”</p>



<p>Phillips also heard from Trevor’s mother. The sparkler belonged to his great-grandmother, and he had swiped it when they were visiting her in Alabama.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Not only did he steal a ring, but he crossed state lines with it,” Phillips joked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adalie is now in second grade, and according to Phillips, she and Brandon have worked things out.</p>



<p>“At first, Brandon was really mad and wouldn’t talk to either of them, but then a week later, she came home and told me that she and Trevor broke up and she was back together with Brandon,” Phillips tells TODAY.</p>



<p>Ah, young love.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>British police on Friday charged comedian Russell Brand with rape and sexual assault after an investigation sparked by complaints from several women.</p>



<p>London’s Metropolitan Police force said Brand, 50, faces one count of rape, one of indecent assault, one of oral rape and two of sexual assault.</p>



<p>The alleged offenses took place between 1999 and 2005.</p>



<p>In September 2023, British media outlets Channel 4 and the Sunday Times published <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/reports-say-russell-brand-interviewed-by-british-police-over-claims-of-sexual-offenses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claims by four women of being sexually assaulted</a> or raped by Brand. The accusers have not been identified.</p>



<p>The comedian, author and “Get Him To The Greek” actor <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/russell-brand-speaks-out-on-sexual-assault-allegations-for-the-first-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has denied the allegations</a>, saying his relationships were “always consensual.”</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Robert Irwin is showing off a more daring side of himself as the star of a new photo campaign for the Australian underwear brand Bonds.</p>



<p>Irwin, the 21-year-old son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/parents/robert-irwin-steve-irwin-photo-rcna80239" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">late “Crocodile Hunter” Steve Irwin</a>, posed for several images in Bonds&#8217; cheeky new &#8220;Made for Down Under&#8221; campaign wearing nothing but his skivvies while joined by a few wild animals.</p>



<div class="wp-block-nbc-html-block html-block"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" style="margin-bottom: 0px" src="https://media.nbcwashington.com/2025/04/steve-irwin-underwear-campaign-mc-250403-03-5edd85.jpg?w=900&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="Irwin" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Robert Irwin stars in Bonds&#8217; new &#8220;Made for Down Under&#8221; underwear campaign. (Bonds)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Bonds, which is currently launching in the United States, shared a video of Robert Irwin on Instagram that showed the young conservationist&nbsp;sitting in a lawn chair with a snake wrapped around his arm and shoulder.</p>



<p>As a tarantula crawls up Irwin’s leg, a crocodile stares at him from nearby in the grass.</p>

<p>Irwin, who inherited his father’s love of wildlife, told&nbsp;<a href="https://people.com/robert-irwin-strips-down-to-his-underwear-in-shocking-underwear-campaign-exclusive-11707203" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>&nbsp;he jumped at the chance to appear in the campaign.</p>



<p>“I mean, I’ve spent my life wrangling crocs and snakes and rescuing animals. And so to feature a little slice of that excitement in this new campaign, mate, it has been so much fun,” he said. “I mean, I’m surrounded by spiders and snakes except (this time) I’m in my undies. That’s the only difference.”</p>







<p>Irwin said he wanted to look his best for the photos since he&#8217;s &#8220;representing Australia.&#8221; That required “more sit-ups” and “less carbs,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Irwin added that staying in shape, for him, isn&#8217;t too difficult thanks to the demands of his everyday life at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/parents/moms/bindi-irwin-motherhood-new-book-dads-legacy-rcna187994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his family&#8217;s Australian Zoo</a>.</p>



<p>“I’ve got to stay pretty fit with all the crazy stuff I’m doing,” he said. ‘I’m saving crocodiles, I’m in and out of the Aussie bush every day and it’s hard work, so you’ve got to keep pretty good upper body strength, good stamina.”</p>



<p>He added, “At Australia Zoo, our beautiful wildlife sanctuary, it’s great, I’ve got about 700 acres to just run. So I’ve been doing a lot of sprints, a lot of hill sprints.”</p>



<p>Irwin made his modeling debut in March 2024 when he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/style/robert-irwin-walks-runway-melbourne-fashion-festival-rcna142447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walked the runway</a>&nbsp;at the Melbourne Fashion Festival.</p>



<p>“Never imagined I’d be walking the runway, but here we are,” Irwin captioned a collection of photos from the event on Instagram. “Wow, thanks for an amazing night Melbourne Fashion Festival!!”</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>The NYPD has arrested a man for allegedly threatening to bomb the <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/tag/saturday-night-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;Saturday Night Live&#8221;</a> studios after he messaged the threat to a Connecticut college and an administrator at that college told police, two people briefed on the matter tell <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/suspect-arrested-threatening-bomb-saturday-night-live-studio-police-sa-rcna199664" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NBC News</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Police identified the man arrested as Michael Branham, 48, who was taken into custody by the NYPD and charged after the threat was discovered on Tuesday, according to an NYPD statement.</p>



<p>The threat was not deemed credible, two law enforcement officials say.</p>



<p>Branham&#8217;s first, middle, last name and age match the person&nbsp;whom Scarlett Johansson has previously accused of stalking in an application for a restraining order, according to court documents filed in California.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Court documents filed in California show that a judge denied that request for a restraining order on a technicality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A representative for Johansson declined to comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A review of social media shows that a person with Branham&#8217;s name and information has made repeated and continuous posts about the actress, who is married to &#8220;SNL Weekend Update&#8221; host Colin Jost.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/03/us-news/scarlett-johanssons-alleged-stalker-arrested-for-threatening-to-bomb-snl-where-hubby-colin-jost-works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Post</a> first reported the threat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Branham faces one count each of making a threat of mass harm and falsely reporting an incident, according to a criminal complaint obtained Friday.</p>



<p>According to that complaint, a phone number registered to Branham texted the Connecticut university official on Monday afternoon: &#8220;THE NEXT TIME YOU HERE FROM ME I WILL BE ON CNN FOR EXPLODING A BOMB IN SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE AUDIENCE&#8221;.</p>



<p>Requests for comment from the attorney representing the man charged in New York were not immediately returned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bail was set at $100,000 cash or $300,000 bond Friday and an order of protection was granted, the district attorney&#8217;s office said. </p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Tom Cruise&nbsp;opened his highly anticipated <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/tag/movies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CinemaCon appearance</a> on Thursday with a moving tribute to his&nbsp;“Top Gun” co-star, <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/national-international/val-kilmer-top-gun-and-batman-star-with-an-intense-approach-dies-at-65/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Val Kilmer,&nbsp;who&nbsp;died Tuesday</a> in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>“He loved movies and he gave a lot to all of us with his performances and his films,” Cruise said to a room full of&nbsp;movie theater owners.&nbsp;“I really can’t tell you how much I admired his work, how much I thought of him as a human being, and how grateful and honored I was when he joined ‘Top Gun’ and then came back for ‘Top Gun: Maverick.’”</p>



<p>Cruise called for a moment of silence, which stood in stark contrast to the otherwise action-packed presentation of Paramount Pictures’ upcoming movies.</p>



<p>“Thank you, Val. I wish you well on your next journey,” he said to the silent room.</p>



<p>Cruise was there to hype “Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning,” the eighth installment of the franchise set to hit theaters May 23.</p>

<p>Given that the 62-year-old is one of the rare stars who is still a near-guarantee for box office success, Cruise is an unsurprising darling of the annual convention and trade show in Las Vegas, where studios hype up cinemas and seek to convince theater owners they can lure audiences out of the house.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cruise’s tribute to McQ</h2>



<p>Most celebrity appearances throughout the convention comprise a few minutes onstage. But Cruise gave a thoughtful, off-the-prompter tribute to Christopher McQuarrie — or as Cruise calls him, McQ — who was honored as CinemaCon’s director of the year.</p>



<p>The speech, followed by a long list of thank-yous to colleagues and the audience, lasted nearly 20 minutes before a new trailer was introduced.</p>



<p>Cruise talked at length about following the filmmaker’s career after McQuarrie, at 26, won <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/tag/academy-awards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Oscar</a> for original screenplay for “The Usual Suspects.”</p>



<p>“Most people are still finding their voices at that age, but McQ had already written a film that changed the cinematic landscape,” Cruise said.</p>



<p>The pair first worked together on the 2008 World War II drama, “Valkyrie,” which McQuarrie co-wrote. “We met in LA in my screening room and we spent hours together talking about movies. And from that meeting, I knew that he was an artist that I was going to work with for the rest of my life. I absolutely knew that he was a creative brother who shares the same love and passion for cinema,” Cruise said.</p>



<p>McQuarrie began directing the “Mission Impossible” franchise with its fifth installment, “Rogue Nation.” Cruise recounted the&nbsp;challenges they’ve faced&nbsp;with the most recent two films, including pandemic lockdowns and Hollywood strikes, and credited McQuarrie with making the films happen.</p>



<p>“He didn’t do it for personal glory, not just to make a film, but truly in recognition of the responsibility that we have for others, for our industry,” Cruise said.</p>

<p>The upcoming film was the highlight of Paramount’s slate. To kick off the presentation, four motorcyclists flew off ramps as smoke shot from the ground, before descending from the stage and weaving around through aisles as the iconic theme song played.</p>



<p>“It’s been an honor and a privilege to work with you, to learn from you, and to place you in harm’s way for other people’s entertainment,” McQuarrie joked to Cruise while accepting the award.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Taking big cinematic swings</h2>



<p>Though Paramount&#8217;s other projects aren&#8217;t expected to rival “Mission Impossible” at the box office, the studio boasted a handful of movies clearly meant to be seen on a big screen.</p>



<p>The first film they teased was Edgar Wright’s upcoming “The Running Man,” a dystopian game show thriller based on the Stephen King novel of the same name. To tease the first footage from the film, actors&nbsp;Glen Powell,&nbsp;who is also being honored as CinemaCon&#8217;s star of the year,&nbsp;Colman Domingo&nbsp;and&nbsp;Josh Brolin&nbsp;hyped the film alongside Wright.</p>



<p>“Now, more than ever, we need movies in the movie theaters that bring people from all different backgrounds and ideologies together, for one simple reason: to be entertained,” Powell said before elaborating on the lengths to which he would go to entertain audiences. “I’ve fallen from buildings, I’ve jumped through explosions, I had my body thrashed and smashed. This is probably what I get for asking Tom Cruise advice on using a stunt double.”</p>



<p>The studio also showed new footage from its upcoming reboot of “The Naked Gun,” which stars&nbsp;Liam Neeson&nbsp;and&nbsp;Pamela Anderson.&nbsp;Channing Tatum, another CinemaCon honoree for distinguished decade of achievement in film, also came out on stage to introduce footage for “Roofman,” a based-on-a-true-story crime thriller about a man who escaped prison after being convicted of&nbsp;several robberies.</p>



<p>The docket was also filled with animated franchises, like “Smurfs,” which stars Rihanna, and “The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants,” which hits theaters in December.</p>



<p>“I actually did an episode of SpongeBob in the fifth season and I did such a good job, they asked me back 18 years later,” said Mark Hamill, who stars in the latter as The Flying Dutchman.</p>



<p>Paramount Pictures CEO Brian Robbins painted a rosy picture of the studio, but acknowledged the&nbsp;company’s merger&nbsp;last year with Skydance.</p>



<p>“I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve accomplished at Paramount Pictures in the midst of all the noise going on at our parent company,” Robbins said.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Much has changed over the course of Alex Ovechkin&#8217;s career, including the record books.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/tag/washington-capitals/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcwashington.com/tag/washington-capitals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Washington Capitals</a> star is expected to rewrite those very soon when he <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/sports/nhl/alex-ovechkin-nhl-goals-record-wayne-gretzky/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/sports/nhl/alex-ovechkin-nhl-goals-record-wayne-gretzky/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scores his 895th career goal</a> to become the NHL&#8217;s all-time leading scorer by breaking the record long held by Wayne Gretzky.</p>

								<excerpt><![CDATA[White Lotus producers recently shared details about the show’s current third season, including the fixed salary the cast—which includes Leslie Bibb, Patrick Schwarzenegger and more—takes home.  ]]></excerpt>

				<![CDATA[
<p><strong><em>Originally appeared on <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1415688/white-lotus-cast-salaries-paychecks-revealed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">E! Online</a></em></strong></p>



<p>It pays to be in the White Lotus.</p>



<p>The HBO series has their characters unwinding (and <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1414851/white-lotus-patrick-schwarzenegger-and-sam-divola-react-to-incestuous-kissing-scene" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">raising incestuous havoc</a>) in the <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1415067/white-lotus-the-real-hotels-featured" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most stunning resorts</a> around the world. That shared comfort carries over to the actors’ real-life salaries, where one of the show’s producers David Bernard revealed the <a href="https://www.eonline.com/photos/37528/the-white-lotus-season-3-where-youve-seen-the-cast-before" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cast</a>—which currently includes Parker Posey, Carrie Coon, Michelle Monaghan, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Jason Isaacs, Blackpink’s Lisa and Natasha Rothwell—gets equal pay.</p>



<p>“Everyone is treated the same on White Lotus,” David detailed in an interview with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/white-lotus-finale-mike-white-interview-1236177751/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a> on April 2. “They get paid the same, and we do alphabetical billing, so you’re getting people who want to do the project for the right reasons.”</p>



<p>According to THR, who also cited multiple sources, the show’s regular actors make “roughly $40,000 an episode.” </p>



<p><b>PHOTOS</b><a href="https://www.eonline.com/photos/37419/the-white-lotus-season-3-photos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> The White Lotus Season 3 Photos</a></p>



<p>David noted this salary is “not negotiable,” and the team used their billing system—which they created to help fund the show’s first season in 2021—to make this price point. THR reports that <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1288582/hbos-dark-comedy-the-white-lotus-might-have-you-rethinking-that-trip-to-hawaii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">season one’s stop in Hawaii</a> cost “$4 million an episode,” while its <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1413901/how-southern-charm-inspired-the-white-lotus-season-3s-ratliff-family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current third season</a>’s budget in Thailand raised between “$6 million and $7 million.”</p>



<p>And so far, this surprising fixed rate has worked for the popular series. The show’s casting director, Meredith Tucker, explained this approach has leveled the playing field. </p>



<p>“It makes it so much easier,” she continued. “You tell people this is what it is. And some won’t do it — and honestly, you can’t hold it against people who need to make a living. Our series regulars are pretty much doing this for scale.” </p>



<p><p style="font-weight:400">Elsewhere in the interview, White Lotus creator Mike White shared that Thailand wasn’t his dream location pick for season three. In fact, he had his eye on another spot in Asia. </p></p>



<p><p style="font-weight:400">“Originally, I wanted to shoot in Japan,” the 54-year-old director added. “I was in Thailand when my dad and I got eliminated from The Amazing Race — two weeks in an elimination station with all these other bitter reality contestants, I was just like, “I don’t ever want to come back here.”</p></p>



<p><p style="font-weight:400">But despite his apprehension, Mike noted HBO pushed for the country because they “had good tax incentives,” and the team visited Thailand shortly after. </p></p>



<p><p style="font-weight:400">Keep reading to fall in love with the show’s previous filming locations…</p></p>

<p><em>Originally appeared on <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1415685/white-lotus-composer-quits-over-mike-white-feud">E! Online</a></em></p>



<p>Cristóbal Tapia de Veer is no longer in harmony with &#8220;<a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/the_white_lotus">The White Lotus</a>.&#8221;</p>



<p>The composer, who has worked on the HBO series for three seasons, revealed that after a dispute about the music on the show with creator Mike White, he won’t be checking in for <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1412489/fate-of-the-white-lotus-revealed-after-season-3">the show’s fourth season</a>.</p>



<p>“I announced to the team a few months ago that I was not coming back, that I was leaving,” Tapia de Veer said during an interview with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/style/white-lotus-composer-season-4-leaving.html">New York Times</a> published April 2. “I didn’t tell Mike for various reasons; I wanted to tell him just at the end for the shock and whatever. Except I told the whole editorial team and music editor and producer and all that, but I didn’t think that they were going to tell him. At some point he heard about that.”</p>



<p>According to Tapia de Veer, his and White’s beef began with the removal of the signature “ooh-loo-loo-loo” and “ooh-loo-loo-loos” from the opening credits score for this season which stars Patrick Schwarzenegger, Walton Goggins, Parker Posey and more. The move changed the theme song completely and left some fans of the series disappointed.</p>

<p>“I texted the producer and I told him that it would be great to, at some point, give them the longer version with the ooh-loo-loo-loos, because people will explode if they realize that it was going there anyway,” Tapia de Veer said. “He thought it was a good idea. But then Mike cut that — he wasn’t happy about that.”</p>



<p>“I mean, at that point, we already had our last fight forever, I think,” he continued. “So, he was just saying no to anything.”</p>



<p>E! News has reached out to Mike White and HBO for comment but has not heard back. </p>

				<![CDATA[
<p><strong><em>Originally appeared on <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1415678/adam-devines-details-lasting-injuries-from-cement-truck-accident" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">E! Online</a></em></strong></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/adam_devine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adam Devine</a>’s childhood accident still has a massive impact on his health.</p>



<p>The &#8220;Workaholics&#8221; actor, who was hit by a cement truck when he was 11 years old, recently revealed that a doctor told him the injuries he sustained from the accident are slowly killing him.</p>



<p>“It’s been a nightmare,” Devine, 41, said in an <a>April 2 episode of the In Depth With Graham Bensinger</a> podcast. “I have spasms all over. For a while, [the doctors] told me I was dying—literally, within this last year.”</p>



<p>The &#8220;Pitch Perfect&#8221; star—who shares 12-month-old son <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1396839/pitch-perfects-adam-devine-and-wife-chloe-bridges-welcome-first-baby" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beau</a> with wife Chloe Bridges—was initially told he might be suffering from Stiff Persons Syndrome (SPS), a disorder where the “muscles gets so tight that you can no longer walk or move.” Of the condition, which <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1357532/celine-dion-diagnosed-with-rare-neurological-disorder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Celine Dion</a> was diagnosed with in 2022, he noted that this restrictive condition can impact the heart, causing it to “become too tight to beat.”</p>

<p>“They told me that I had that a month before my son was born,” Devine added, before revealing the doctors walked back his diagnosis six months later. Despite that retraction, the Righteous Gemstones actor knew his health wasn’t in the greatest place. “I could only walk a few blocks before I’ll get so tight that I couldn’t move anymore,&#8221; Devine said.</p>

<p>However, after a second opinion confirmed he didn’t have SPS, he was told that his recent muscle discomfort stemmed from his former encounter with the cement truck. </p>



<p>And now, Devine believes that his workout regimen—a mixture of cycling and doing CrossFit—he started “three years ago” might’ve triggered his mysterious symptoms.</p>



<p>“I think I just got so tight,” he explained. “My body has all these things that are a little wonky and a little wrong with it, that I just sort of snapped.”</p>



<p>The &#8220;Modern Family&#8221; alum has recalled details from that near-fatal moment over the years, including showing a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/adamdevine/p/BcDW3cylDXG/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">throwback photo of him in the hospital</a> as a kid on Instagram.</p>



<p>“I couldn’t walk for two years and had to completely relearn how to walk,” he reflected in the 2017 post. “The nurses would always come in and have to adjust my legs, which were fully skin grafted and in traction. The pain was next level.” </p>

<p>“I’ll be really honest, there was a time, for quite a while, that just hearing the theme song would really — you know what I mean? I just had that reaction. I just had heard it so many times,&#8221; Schwimmer added. &#8220;And anytime you’d go on a show, or a talk show, or an interview, that would be your intro song. I just didn’t have the greatest response to it for a period of time.”</p>



<p>The star, who played Ross Geller in the hit &#8217;90s sitcom, explained that things didn&#8217;t change for him until his 13-year-old daughter, Cleo, got into the show.</p>



<p>&#8220;At about &#8230; age 9, my kid discovered it and started watching it. And I&#8217;d be making breakfast, or whatever, and I&#8217;d hear my kid&#8217;s laughter. My whole relationship to that song and to the show changed again,&#8221; he said.</p>







<p>Schwimmer joked that &#8220;it is different when you don&#8217;t force a child to watch your work.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Friends&#8221; debuted in 1994, and it ended in 2004. The series starred Schwimmer, Jennifer Aniston,&nbsp;Lisa Kudrow,&nbsp;Courteney Cox,&nbsp;Matt LeBlanc&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/news/matthew-perry-friends-recall-final-days-rcna177357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the late&nbsp;Matthew Perry</a>&nbsp;as best friends living in New York City. The show, which immediately became popular among viewers, won numerous awards, including a 2002 Emmy for outstanding comedy series.</p>



<p>In September 2024, the show celebrated its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/video/-friends-creators-reflect-on-30-years-of-iconic-television-show-219785797886" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30th anniversary</a>. In honor of the milestone, &#8220;Friends&#8221; creators David Crane and Marta Kauffman, along with executive producer Kevin Bright,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/friends-creators-30th-show-anniversary-rcna171953" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke with NBC’s Joe Fryer</a>&nbsp;about the show&#8217;s impact on younger generations.</p>

<p>Bruce Springsteen will open his vault in late June and debut 83 previously unreleased songs, the rock legend announced on Thursday.</p>



<p>“Tracks II: The Lost Albums” will be comprised of seven &#8220;full-length records&#8221; and be available on June 27 through Sony Music, the E Street Band front man said in a statement.</p>



<p>“&#8217;The Lost Albums’ were full records, some of them even to the point of being mixed and not released,” said Springsteen. “I’ve played this music to myself and often close friends for years now. I’m glad you’ll get a chance to finally hear them. I hope you enjoy them.”</p>



<p>The release appears to coincide with the upcoming film “Deliver Me From Nowhere,” a biopic about&nbsp;<a href="https://rockhall.com/inductees/bruce-springsteen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame</a>&nbsp;icon starring &#8220;The Bear&#8221; actor&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/jeremy-allen-white-talks-play-bruce-springsteen-movie-making-nebraska-rcna146880" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeremy Allen White</a>&nbsp;as The Boss.</p>

<p>The rapper confirmed speculation that he and his wife <a style=", sans-serif" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1414414/amber-rose-shares-theory-on-ex-kanye-west-dressing-wife-bianca-censori-in-nsfw-clothes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bianca Censori</a> are no longer on the same page after two years of marriage in his song, &#8220;BIANCA,&#8221; from his latest album &#8220;WW3.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the single&#8217;s lyrics published by Genius April 2, West pleas for his now-estranged wife to return on the heels of his recent controversial social media posts.</p>



<p>“My baby she ran away,&#8221; Ye raps, &#8220;But first she tried to get me committed / Not going to the hospital ’cause I am not sick I just do not get it.” </p>



<p>He adds, “She’s having a panic attack and she is not liking the way that I tweeted / Until Bianca’s back I stay up all night I’m not going to sleep / I really don’t know where she’s at.”</p>

<p>West&#8217;s latest song comes nearly two weeks after he fueled breakup rumors with a cryptic message about heartbreak.</p>



<p>&#8220;When you look at that betrayal list I realized I was just a part of peoples strategies,&#8221; he <a href="https://x.com/kanyewest/status/1903205898874663349" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> in part. &#8220;I took the word love to mean love when it really meant I love the opportunity.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ye continued, &#8220;I make decisions from my heart and mind. So when my heart is broken it breaks my mind too. That’s why I drank Henny to go to the awards that night. Just too many slaps in in the face.&#8221;</p>



<p>He accompanied the message with a screenshot of a redacted text exchange, saying he &#8220;would sign&#8221; something and saying he doesn&#8217;t &#8220;care&#8221; about the &#8220;terms proposed.&#8221;</p>

The rapper released his surprise album Bully March 19 <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1414994/kanye-west-includes-his-and-kim-kardashians-son-saint-west-in-video-for-surprise-new-album" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">featuring his eldest son</a> in a short film introducing the project.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">Saint wasn’t the only one of his kids to team up with their dad. Just days before dropping the visuals, he enlisted North’s help for his track “Lonely Roads Still Go to Sunshine,” which also featured</span> Sean “Diddy” Combs<span style="font-weight:400">.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">The cameo with the rap mogul — who is currently incarcerated on charges related to sex trafficking that he pleaded not guilty to — appeared to <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1414842/kanye-west-drops-song-with-north-west-and-diddy-against-kim-kardashians-request" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clash with Kardashian’s beliefs on the decision</a>.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">West — who has been vocal about his support for Combs — shared a now-deleted alleged text conversation with his ex over trademarking North’s name.</span></p>

<p>Glen Powell spoke about reuniting with his &#8220;Anyone But You&#8221; co-star Sydney Sweeney recently at his sister&#8217;s wedding in <a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/glen-powell-sydney-sweeney-sister-leslie-wedding-rcna199274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a TODAY exclusive</a> on Wednesday.</p>



<p>The &#8220;Twisters&#8221; star celebrated the wedding of his younger sister, Leslie Powell, in his native Texas over the weekend and confirmed Sweeney was in attendance as he described her relationship with his sister.</p>



<p>&#8220;Timing is everything in this world, isn&#8217;t it? She and Syd are obviously great friends and it was a hell of a wedding,&#8221; Powell told Jenna Bush Hager and guest co-host Olivia Munn on TODAY with Jenna &amp; Friends. &#8220;The Powells know how to do it right, so all the people that love her were there.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sweeney posed for a photo with Leslie Powell that was shared by wedding photographer Lyndi Stucky on her Instagram stories on March 30, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1415516/sydney-sweeney-glen-powell-spark-romance-rumors-at-wedding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">E! News</a>.</p>







<p>Glen Powell gave a speech at the wedding as his family enjoyed a happy weekend celebrating Leslie.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was just such a fun, rowdy wedding,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The Powells know how to crank it up.&#8221;</p>



<p>Powell, 36, served as a groomsman but joked that he was selected to deliver a speech because he was &#8220;probably the lowest liability in the family.&#8221; He called himself the &#8220;master of ceremonies of the wedding.&#8221;</p>



<p>The reunion with Sweeney, 27, caused a stir among fans, less than a year after the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/movies/glen-powell-sydney-sweeney-romance-rumors-rcna149223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flirty press tour</a>&nbsp;between the co-stars for &#8220;Anyone But You&#8221; sparked rumors of a budding romance.</p>



<p>In her opening monologue while hosting &#8220;Saturday Night Live&#8221; in March 2024, Sweeney&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/sydney-sweeney-glen-powell-snl-rcna141546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">addressed rumors</a>&nbsp;that she cheated on her fiancé, Jonathan Davino, with Powell while filming &#8220;Anyone But You.&#8221;</p>



<p>“That’s obviously not true. Me and my fiancé produced the movie together and he was there the entire shoot,” Sweeney said of Davino.</p>
